# P0-016 Test Suite Stabilization - Progress Summary

## Work Completed (2025-07-17)

### 1. CI Pipeline Fixes
- Fixed Ultra-Fast CI pipeline by adding missing dependencies (pydantic-settings, requests, uvicorn)
- Fixed Fast CI pipeline with same dependency updates
- Both CI pipelines now passing successfully

### 2. Test Fixes
- Fixed `test_visual_analyzer.py::test_stub_mode_behavior` - corrected trust_signals score calculation
- Fixed `test_guardrail_middleware.py::test_rate_limit_allows_within_limit` - initialized rate limiter tokens
- Fixed `test_visual_analyzer.py::test_malformed_json_response` - updated expected scores for clamping
- Fixed `test_guardrail_middleware.py::test_check_budget_available` - fixed datetime mock objects

### 3. Re-enabled xfail Tests
- Successfully re-enabled 19 tests that were incorrectly marked as xfail:
  - 5/6 SEMrush adapter tests (Phase 0.5 feature implemented)
  - 5/6 impact calculator tests (Phase 0.5 feature implemented)
  - 9/9 simple Phase 0.5 tests (after fixing cost expectations)

### 4. Coverage Improvements
- **Starting coverage**: 62.2%
- **Current coverage**: 66.67%
- **Improvement**: 4.47%
- **Gap to 80% target**: 13.33%

### 5. New Tests Created
- Added 29 comprehensive tests for `d2_sourcing/exceptions.py`
- All tests passing successfully

### 6. Code Cleanup
- Archived 27 unused Python files from root directory
- Reduced total lines from ~28,306 to ~27,176
- Improved coverage baseline by removing untested code

### 7. Stability Testing
- Ran 3 consecutive test runs on core tests
- All 3 runs passed successfully (20 tests each)
- Tests completed in 5.56s, 6.47s, and 5.76s respectively

## Remaining Work

### 1. Coverage Gap (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Need to increase coverage from 66.67% to 80% (13.33% gap)
- Focus areas for new tests:
  - d0_gateway modules with <30% coverage
  - d2_sourcing/coordinator.py (23.61% coverage)
  - d5_scoring/rules_schema.py (29.44% coverage)

### 2. Test Failures
- 7 test failures remain according to validation report
- These need to be fixed before final stability assessment

### 3. Stability Validation
- Need to complete 10 consecutive test runs (only did 3 so far)
- Cannot validate pre-push until all tests pass

## PRP Score Progress
- Previous score: 72/100
- Target score: 100/100
- Main blockers: Coverage gap and remaining test failures

## Time Investment
- Approximately 3-4 hours of work completed
- Estimated 1-2 days more needed for full completion
