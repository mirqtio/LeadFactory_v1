# PRP-P0-014: Test Suite Re-Enablement and Coverage Plan

## Summary
Reintroduce full KEEP test coverage, optimize test structure for CI reliability, and establish a path to restore coverage ≥70%.

## Business Logic
Phase 0.5 tooling, especially for the CPO, requires confidence in rule, config, and evaluator correctness. Rebuilding full test coverage allows those tools to validate pipeline behavior safely.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All KEEP tests either run, are `xfail`, or are conditionally skipped with markers
- [ ] CI test collection time remains under 30 seconds
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows pass with full test suite enabled or split
- [ ] Test time reduced via selective markers or job matrix
- [ ] Formula evaluator test structure supports partial implementation
- [ ] Coverage reports show ≥70% coverage on core modules

## Dependencies
- P0-013 (must have green CI before extending)

## Integration Points
- `tests/` structure and pytest config
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` (if matrix strategy added)
- `conftest.py` or `pytest.ini` marker logic
- Formula evaluator test modules
- Coverage reporting configuration

## Tests to Pass
- KEEP suite runs end-to-end in CI (with `xfail` isolation)
- Test matrix doesn't exceed runner timeout limit
- Phase 0.5 formula logic does not regress
- Coverage percentage meets threshold

## Rollback Strategy
If test re-enable breaks CI, fallback to prior ignore list, isolate failing files, and track re-enable path in PR.

## Implementation Notes

### Current State Analysis
- Only 3 test files currently run in CI (test_core.py, test_unit_models.py, test_setup.py)
- Test collection taking 11.48s (was targeting <5s, now relaxed to <20s)
- 618 tests deselected to avoid timeout
- Formula evaluator tests failing due to missing ModelCompiler.compile method
- PostgreSQL container tests fail in CI environment

### Proposed Approach
1. **Test Splitting Strategy**
   - Create test matrix in GitHub Actions
   - Split by domain (d1-d11) or by test type (unit/integration/e2e)
   - Run in parallel jobs to reduce total time

2. **Collection Time Optimization**
   - Use pytest-xdist for parallel collection
   - Implement lazy imports in test files
   - Consider pytest plugins for collection optimization

3. **XFAIL Management**
   - Create clear Phase 0.5 marker system
   - Document expected timeline for each XFAIL
   - Set up monitoring for unexpected XPASS

4. **Coverage Recovery Plan**
   - Start with core business logic modules
   - Add integration tests for critical paths
   - Use coverage reports to identify gaps

## Success Metrics
- All 5 CI workflows green with full test suite
- Test collection time <30s
- Total test runtime <10 minutes
- Coverage ≥70% on non-stub code
- Zero flaky tests in main suite
