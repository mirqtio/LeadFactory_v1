Task 063 Verification Test - Create spam score checker

Simple verification test for spam score checking with rule-based analysis,
score reduction logic, and common pattern detection.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Basic spam scoring âœ“
- Rule-based checks âœ“
- Score reduction logic âœ“
- Common patterns caught âœ“
