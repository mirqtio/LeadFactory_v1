  blocking_issues:

    - "No verification that changes work in production CI environment"
    - "Local environment != CI environment (different dependencies, versions)"

  major_achievements:
    - "Prerequisites module: 40/40 tests passing (fixed 7 failing tests)"
    - "Backend/API coverage: 5 new test files created (3,275 lines)"
    - "Core infrastructure tests: audit middleware, alerts, health checks"
    - "Local validation: make quick-check passes (60/60 tests)"
    - "Test execution: fast and stable locally"
    - "Code quality: linting and formatting pass"
    - "Comprehensive test coverage for critical components"
