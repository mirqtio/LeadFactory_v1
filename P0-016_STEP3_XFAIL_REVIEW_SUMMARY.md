# P0-016 Step 3: xfail Test Review Summary

## Tests Successfully Re-enabled (3 tests)

### 1. test_multiplier_boundaries (d4_enrichment/test_company_size.py)
- **Issue**: CSV data had range "1-9" but test expected "0-9"
- **Fix**: Updated CSV to include 0 employees in the 0.4 multiplier range
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING

### 2. test_create_trust_finding_low_reviews (d3_assessment/test_gbp_adapter.py)
- **Issue**: Severity mapping returned MEDIUM instead of HIGH for low review counts
- **Fix**: Updated rubric.py to check both rating AND review_count, returning worst severity
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING

### 3. test_severity_mapping_integration (d3_assessment/test_gbp_adapter.py)
- **Issue**: Same as above - severity mapping logic issue
- **Fix**: Same fix to rubric.py resolved this test as well
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING

## Tests Remaining as xfail (69 tests)

### Category 1: Missing Implementation (58 tests)
- **Health Endpoint (17 tests)**: Waiting for P0-007 implementation
- **Wave B Features (23 tests)**: D11 orchestration/experiments not implemented
- **Cost Tracking (5 tests)**: Advanced features (caps, webhooks) not implemented
- **AI Agent (7 tests)**: Entire module not implemented
- **Other (6 tests)**: URL validation, enrichment fanout, remote health

### Category 2: Test Environment Issues (6 tests)
- **API Key Dependencies (3 tests)**: DataAxle, Hunter, GBP need real keys
- **Docker/PostgreSQL (3 tests)**: Container management, DB-specific features

### Category 3: Infrastructure Issues (5 tests)
- **Parallel Test Isolation (2 tests)**: Database/Redis isolation not configured
- **Port Binding (1 test)**: SEMrush cache test has port conflicts
- **Fixture Conflicts (1 test)**: Development stub choice conflicts with autouse fixture
- **Phase 0.5 (1 test)**: Enrichment fanout marked for future phase

## Impact on Coverage

- **Before Step 3**: 62.2% coverage with 72 xfail tests
- **After Step 3**: ~62.5% coverage with 69 xfail tests
- **Gain**: +0.3% from re-enabling 3 tests

## Recommendations

1. **Keep as xfail**: All 69 remaining tests have legitimate reasons
2. **Priority for future work**:
   - P0-007 Health Endpoint would enable 17 tests
   - Cost tracking enhancements would enable 5 tests
   - The rest are future features or environment-specific

## Next Step

Proceed to Step 4: Analyze coverage gaps and create new tests to reach 80% coverage target.
