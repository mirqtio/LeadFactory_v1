- CI validation steps defined ✅

## Final Status: PASSED ✅
**Score**: 100/100

## Key Improvements Made:
1. **Fixed root cause**: Added comprehensive model imports to alembic/env.py
2. **Added validation framework**: Created tests/unit/test_migrations.py
3. **Enhanced automation**: Added pre-commit hooks and CI validation script
4. **Improved security**: Added warnings about sensitive data in migrations
5. **Better rollback strategy**: Three-tier rollback approach with data safety

## Outstanding Issues:
The actual implementation reveals that some models defined in the codebase don't have corresponding migrations yet. This is expected for Wave B features but needs to be addressed when those features are implemented.

## Recommendation:
The PRP is now comprehensive and ready for implementation. The developer implementing this should:
1. Apply the env.py fix first
2. Run the test suite to verify current state
3. Create any missing migrations for Wave A models only
4. Ensure CI passes before marking complete
