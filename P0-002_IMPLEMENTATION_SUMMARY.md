# P0-002: Wire Prefect Full Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the end-to-end Prefect pipeline that chains all LeadFactory coordinators together to process a business from targeting through delivery.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Flow Structure** (`flows/full_pipeline_flow.py`)
- Created a complete pipeline flow with 6 stages:
  1. **Target**: Identifies and validates business from URL
  2. **Source**: Gathers business data (MVP uses mock data)
  3. **Assess**: Runs comprehensive website assessment
  4. **Score**: Calculates quality score and tier (A-D)
  5. **Report**: Generates PDF report
  6. **Deliver**: Sends email with report

### 2. **Key Fixes Applied**
- **Method Name Corrections**:
  - Changed `assess_business()` → `execute_comprehensive_assessment()`
  - Changed `score_lead()` → `calculate_score()` (and made it sync)
  - Removed dependency on non-existent `source_single_business()`
  
- **Async/Sync Handling**:
  - Fixed scoring engine to use synchronous `calculate_score()` method
  - Properly handled Prefect context vs non-Prefect execution
  - Added `.fn` accessor for running tasks outside Prefect context

- **Error Handling**:
  - Non-critical failures (assessment, email) allow pipeline to continue
  - Critical failures (report generation) stop the pipeline
  - All errors are logged with appropriate context

### 3. **Test Coverage**

#### Smoke Tests (`tests/smoke/test_full_pipeline_flow.py`)
All 7 tests passing:
- ✅ `test_full_pipeline_success` - Complete end-to-end execution
- ✅ `test_pipeline_json_output` - Valid JSON with score and report path
- ✅ `test_pipeline_with_assessment_failure` - Continues with default score
- ✅ `test_pipeline_with_email_failure` - Completes despite email failure
- ✅ `test_pipeline_critical_failure` - Fails appropriately on report error
- ✅ `test_pipeline_performance` - Completes within 90 seconds
- ✅ `test_pipeline_flow_decorated` - Prefect decorators properly applied

#### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/flows/test_full_pipeline_flow.py`)
Created 16 unit tests covering:
- Individual task functions
- Error handling scenarios  
- Score tier calculation logic
- Retry behavior
- Edge cases

#### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_full_pipeline_integration.py`)
Created integration tests for:
- Full pipeline with stubs
- Error recovery
- Data flow through stages
- Concurrent execution

### 4. **Performance Requirements Met**
- Pipeline completes in < 90 seconds (requirement)
- Individual stage timeouts configured:
  - Targeting: 5 minutes
  - Sourcing: 10 minutes
  - Assessment: 15 minutes
  - Scoring: 5 minutes
  - Report Generation: 10 minutes
  - Email Delivery: 5 minutes

### 5. **Logging and Monitoring**
- Entry/exit logging for each stage
- Execution time tracked per stage
- Correlation ID through business_id
- Error context preserved

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **All criteria met:**
- [x] Flow chains: Target → Source → Assess → Score → Report → Deliver
- [x] Error handling with retries at each stage
- [x] Metrics logged at each stage with proper logging
- [x] Integration test creates PDF and email record (mocked in tests)
- [x] Pipeline continues on non-critical failures (e.g., email)
- [x] Pipeline fails on critical failures (e.g., report generation)
- [x] All coordinator methods called correctly match actual implementations
- [x] Execution time tracked and reported
- [x] Overall test coverage ≥ 80% after implementation
- [x] No performance regression (operations remain efficient)
- [x] All tests in test_full_pipeline_flow.py pass
- [x] Pipeline handles both async and sync coordinator methods
- [x] Proper error messages and logging at each stage

## Key Decisions

1. **MVP Sourcing**: Since SourcingCoordinator lacks a single-business method, created minimal mock data for MVP demo
2. **Tier Calculation**: Implemented A-D tier system based on score ranges (A≥90, B≥75, C≥60, D<60)
3. **Test Isolation**: Made flow work both with and without Prefect context for easier testing
4. **Error Strategy**: Assessment failures use default score (50), email failures don't stop pipeline

## Files Created/Modified

**Modified:**
- `flows/full_pipeline_flow.py` - Complete pipeline implementation

**Created:**
- `tests/unit/flows/test_full_pipeline_flow.py` - Unit tests
- `tests/unit/flows/__init__.py` - Package init
- `tests/integration/test_full_pipeline_integration.py` - Integration tests
- `P0-002_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Next Steps

1. **Production Readiness**:
   - Wire up real DataAxle provider when available (P0.5)
   - Implement actual sourcing coordinator integration
   - Add Prometheus metrics for monitoring

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add caching for assessment results
   - Implement batch processing support
   - Add circuit breakers for external services

3. **Observability**:
   - Add OpenTelemetry tracing
   - Create Grafana dashboards
   - Set up alerting for failures
