# Complete xfail Tests Analysis Report

## Summary Statistics

- **Total xfail tests**: 72 tests across 38 files
- **Categories**:
  - Missing Implementation/Feature: 58 tests (80.6%)
  - Test Environment Issues: 6 tests (8.3%)
  - Implementation Mismatches: 8 tests (11.1%)

## Detailed Analysis by Category

### 1. Missing Implementation/Feature (58 tests)

#### Health Endpoint (P0-007) - 17 tests
**Files**: `test_health.py`, `test_health_performance.py`
- All health endpoint functionality is not implemented
- Once P0-007 is complete, these 17 tests can be re-enabled
- **Priority**: HIGH (basic infrastructure)

#### Wave B Features (D11 Orchestration) - 23 tests
**Files**: `test_api.py`, `test_experiments.py`, `test_d11_models.py`
- Experiment management APIs not implemented
- Schema mismatch: model uses 'id' instead of 'experiment_id'
- **Priority**: LOW (future feature)

#### Cost Tracking Enhancements - 5 tests
**File**: `test_cost_enforcement.py`
- Advanced cost features: caps, webhooks, detailed reporting
- Basic cost tracking works, advanced features missing
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (nice to have)

#### AI Agent Integration - 7 tests
**File**: `test_ai_agent.py`
- Entire AI agent module not implemented
- Marked as Phase 0.5 feature
- **Priority**: LOW (future feature)

#### Other Missing Features - 6 tests
- URL validation (3 tests)
- Enrichment fanout orchestration (1 test)
- Remote health checks (2 tests)

### 2. Test Environment Issues (6 tests)

#### API Key Dependencies - 3 tests
- DataAxle, Hunter, and GBP tests require real API keys
- **Recommendation**: Keep as xfail for CI, enable locally with keys

#### Docker/PostgreSQL Requirements - 3 tests
- Container management and PostgreSQL-specific features
- **Recommendation**: Keep as xfail for unit tests, enable in integration

### 3. Implementation Mismatches (8 tests)

#### High Priority Fixes - Can Be Re-enabled Quickly
1. **test_multiplier_boundaries** (`test_company_size.py`)
   - CSV data range mismatch (1-5 vs 0-4)
   - **Fix**: Update CSV or test expectations

2. **test_create_trust_finding_low_reviews** (`test_gbp_adapter.py`)
   - Severity calculation mismatch
   - **Fix**: Align severity logic

3. **test_severity_mapping_integration** (`test_gbp_adapter.py`)
   - Severity mapping differences
   - **Fix**: Update mapping logic

#### Medium Priority Fixes
- SemRush schema expectations (1 test)
- Cost tracking logic mismatches (4 tests)

## Recommendations for Step 3

### Immediate Actions (Quick Wins)
1. Fix the 3 high-priority implementation mismatches
2. Review and align cost tracking implementation with test expectations
3. Update CSV data files to match test boundaries

### Decision Required
1. **Health Endpoint**: Is P0-007 scheduled? If yes, when?
2. **Wave B Features**: Keep as xfail or remove until Wave B?
3. **AI Agent**: Keep tests for future or remove?

### Tests to Keep as xfail
- Environment-specific tests (API keys, Docker)
- Unscheduled features (Wave B, AI agent)
- External dependency tests

## Next Steps

1. **Quick Fixes First**: Address the 3 high-priority mismatches
2. **Review Features**: Decide on unimplemented features
3. **Clean Up**: Remove tests for features that won't be implemented
4. **Document**: Update test documentation with xfail reasons

## Coverage Impact

Removing xfail tests would improve coverage percentage by:
- Removing denominator without adding coverage
- Current coverage: 62.2%
- Estimated after cleanup: ~64-65%

Re-enabling the fixable tests would add:
- ~200-300 lines of covered code
- Estimated coverage gain: +1-2%

Total potential coverage after Step 3: ~65-67%
