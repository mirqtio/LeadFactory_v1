  recommendations:
    - "Fix the 4 failing core gateway tests as immediate priority"
    - "Review and clean up XPASS tests - either remove xfail markers or fix underlying issues"
    - "Fix test collection warnings by removing __init__ constructors from test classes"
    - "Implement better test categorization to prevent timeouts"
