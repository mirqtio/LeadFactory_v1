summary: |
  Significant progress has been made on P0-016. All test collection errors and 
  Pydantic warnings have been resolved, and test execution time is excellent at 
  69.43 seconds. However, the PRP cannot be marked complete due to:
  
  1. Coverage gap of 17.8% (at 62.2%, need 80%)
  2. 7 remaining test failures preventing stability validation
  3. Pre-push validation cannot be confirmed with failing tests
  
  The infrastructure and tooling work is complete, but the core stability and
  coverage requirements are not yet met.
