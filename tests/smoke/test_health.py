Smoke test for health endpoint - P0-007

Tests that the health endpoint returns proper status including
database and Redis connectivity checks.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Returns 200 with JSON status
- Checks database connectivity
- Checks Redis connectivity
- Returns version info
- <100ms response time
