# Performance Testing Framework
**LeadFactory Production Monitoring & Performance Validation**

## Overview
Comprehensive performance testing framework for validating P3-003 Lead Explorer Audit Trail and P2-040 Budget Monitoring systems before production deployment.

## Framework Components

### 1. P3-003 Audit Performance Tests
**File**: `tests/performance/test_p3_003_audit_performance.py`

**Test Coverage**:
- **Audit Log Creation**: <50ms per operation validation
- **Bulk Operations**: <500ms for 10 operations, <50ms average per log
- **Query Performance**: <100ms for audit log reporting queries
- **Session Event Overhead**: <100ms total operation time with auto-audit
- **Concurrent Operations**: Linear scaling validation (1, 5, 10 users)

**Key Metrics**:
```python
# Performance Requirements
- Audit log creation: <50ms per operation
- Bulk logging: <500ms total, <50ms average per log
- Query performance: <100ms for audit reporting
- Session overhead: <100ms for lead operations with audit
- Concurrent scaling: <50ms per operation regardless of user count
```

### 2. Production Monitoring Performance Tests
**File**: `tests/performance/test_production_monitoring.py`

**Test Coverage**:
- **Concurrent Load Testing**: Thread-based simulation of production load
- **Multi-User Performance**: 5-20 concurrent users with mixed operations
- **Memory Stability**: Sustained load memory usage validation
- **Error Recovery**: Performance during error scenarios and recovery
- **System Health Checks**: Comprehensive component validation

**Key Metrics**:
```python
# Production Requirements
- Concurrent load: <100ms average operation under 10+ users
- System throughput: >10 operations per second
- Memory stability: <50MB increase during sustained operations
- Error recovery: <100ms average recovery time
- Health checks: <200ms total system validation
```

### 3. Integration Performance Tests
**File**: `tests/performance/test_integration_performance.py`

**Test Coverage**:
- **Audit + Budget Integration**: Combined operation performance
- **Budget Circuit Breaker**: Performance when budget limits trigger
- **Concurrent Integration**: Multiple users with audit+budget operations
- **Load Degradation Analysis**: Performance characteristics under increasing load
- **Error Cascade Prevention**: Isolation and recovery validation

**Key Metrics**:
```python
# Integration Requirements
- Combined operations: <75ms for audit+budget operations
- Circuit breaker: <50ms operation time when triggered
- Concurrent integration: <150ms with 8 concurrent users
- Load degradation: <3.0x performance degradation at max load
- Error isolation: <100ms recovery time per component
```

## Production Deployment Validation

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [x] **Performance Benchmarks**: All targets met or exceeded
- [x] **Concurrent Load Testing**: 10+ users validated
- [x] **Memory Stability**: <50MB increase confirmed
- [x] **Error Recovery**: Isolation and recovery validated
- [x] **Integration Testing**: P3-003 + P2-040 integration confirmed

### Continuous Monitoring
The performance framework provides ongoing production monitoring capabilities:

1. **Real-time Performance Metrics**: Audit and budget operation timing
2. **Memory Usage Tracking**: Sustained operation monitoring
3. **Error Rate Monitoring**: Recovery time and isolation validation
4. **Throughput Analysis**: Operations per second under load

### Production Alert Thresholds
```python
# Performance Alerts
AUDIT_OPERATION_THRESHOLD = 50  # ms
BUDGET_CHECK_THRESHOLD = 10     # ms
MEMORY_INCREASE_THRESHOLD = 50  # MB
ERROR_RECOVERY_THRESHOLD = 100  # ms
THROUGHPUT_MINIMUM = 15         # ops/sec
```

## Framework Architecture

### Test Isolation
- **SQLite In-Memory**: Isolated database per test
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Concurrent user simulation
- **Context Management**: Proper audit context setup/teardown
- **Resource Cleanup**: Memory and connection management

### Statistical Analysis
- **Mean Performance**: Average operation times
- **P95 Analysis**: 95th percentile performance targets
- **Throughput Calculation**: Operations per second under load
- **Memory Tracking**: Resource usage over time

### Error Simulation
- **Database Errors**: Constraint and connection failures
- **Audit Context Failures**: Context unavailability scenarios
- **Budget Calculation Errors**: Invalid budget scenarios
- **Recovery Validation**: System isolation and recovery

## Integration with CI/CD

### Development Workflow
1. **Pre-commit**: `make test-performance-audit` (fastest validation)
2. **Pre-push**: `make test-performance` (comprehensive validation)
3. **CI Pipeline**: `make test-performance-full` (with coverage)

### Production Deployment
