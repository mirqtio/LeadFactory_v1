# LeadFactory MVP Task Plan Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive task plan for building the LeadFactory MVP following CI-first development principles. The plan contains 100 tasks organized into 15 phases, designed to deliver a revenue-generating system within 48-72 hours.

## Key Principles

### CI-First Development
- **Every task includes tests** that must pass in Docker before committing
- **Docker environment matches CI exactly** - no "works on my machine" issues
- **All tests run in containers** using the same Python 3.11.0 and dependencies
- **GitHub Actions verify every commit** before merging

### Test-Driven Approach
1. Write tests first (or alongside implementation)
2. Run tests in Docker: `docker run --rm leadfactory-test pytest tests/...`
3. Verify CI compatibility: `python scripts/ci_check.py`
4. Commit only when all tests pass in Docker
5. Push and verify GitHub Actions succeed

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 001-009)

### Phase 13: D11 Orchestration (Tasks 075-079)
**Goal**: Pipeline coordination
- Prefect workflows
- A/B experiment management
- Error handling and retries

### Phase 14: Integration Testing (Tasks 080-089)
**Goal**: End-to-end verification
- Complete flow testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Security verification
- 80%+ code coverage

### Phase 15: Deployment (Tasks 090-100)
**Goal**: Production launch
- Configuration setup
- External API verification
- Initial campaigns
- First batch execution

## Execution Guidelines

### For Each Task:

1. **Read the task details** in `taskmaster_plan.json`
2. **Check dependencies** - ensure prerequisite tasks are complete
3. **Create test files first** as specified in `test_requirements`
4. **Implement the feature** following acceptance criteria
5. **Run Docker tests** using the commands provided
6. **Fix any failures** until all tests pass
7. **Commit with CI verification**

### Critical Path

The following tasks are on the critical path and block subsequent work:
- Task 001: Project setup
- Task 002: Database models
- Task 010: Gateway base
- Task 076: Pipeline orchestration
- Task 093: Production deployment

### Time Estimates

- **Total estimated hours**: ~150 hours
- **With AI assistance**: 48-72 hours possible
- **Phases can overlap** where dependencies allow
- **Focus on critical path** first

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- All tests passing in Docker
- CI pipeline green
- <2% error rate in production
- <30s report generation

### Business Success
- 5,000 businesses processed daily
- 100+ emails sent
- 0.25-0.6% conversion rate
- First revenue within 72 hours

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run tests for a specific domain
docker run --rm leadfactory-test pytest tests/unit/d0_gateway/

# Run all tests
docker run --rm leadfactory-test pytest

# Check CI compatibility
python scripts/ci_check.py

# Run specific test file
docker run --rm leadfactory-test pytest tests/unit/d0_gateway/test_base.py -xvs

# Generate coverage report
docker run --rm leadfactory-test pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Start local environment
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Run pipeline locally
python -m d11_orchestration.pipeline --date today --limit 10
```

## Getting Started

1. Create project directory and initialize git
2. Copy the PRD and task plan files
3. Start with Task 001: Setup project structure
4. Use TaskMaster MCP to track progress
5. Follow CI-first principles religiously
6. Aim for first test email within 48 hours

Remember: **Every line of code must be tested in Docker before committing!**
