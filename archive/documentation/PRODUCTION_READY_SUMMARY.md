### 📋 Pre-Deployment Requirements

Before deploying to production, you MUST:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in ALL production API keys
   - Generate a strong SECRET_KEY
   - Configure PostgreSQL connection string

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Set up PostgreSQL database (don't use SQLite)
   - Configure Redis with password
   - Set up SSL certificates
   - Configure domain and DNS

3. **Security**
   - Rotate any keys that may have been exposed
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Set up rate limiting
   - Restrict CORS to production domain

4. **Monitoring**
   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana
   - Configure Sentry for error tracking
   - Set up log aggregation
   - Configure uptime monitoring

### 🚀 Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended for single server)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

#### Option 2: Kubernetes (For scale)
- Use provided configurations as base
- Add Helm charts for easier management
- Configure horizontal pod autoscaling

#### Option 3: Traditional Server
- Use systemd service file
- Configure nginx as reverse proxy
- Set up process manager (supervisor/systemd)

### 📊 Key Metrics to Monitor

Post-deployment, monitor these KPIs:
- API response times (target: <200ms p95)
- Error rates (target: <0.1%)
- Database connection pool usage
- Redis cache hit rates
- Email delivery success rates
- Payment processing success

### 🔧 Operational Considerations

1. **Backups**: Daily automated database backups
2. **Updates**: Weekly dependency updates
3. **Scaling**: Monitor worker usage and scale as needed
4. **Logs**: Centralize logs for easier debugging
5. **Alerts**: Configure PagerDuty or similar for critical alerts

### 📝 Final Notes

The LeadFactory MVP is now production-ready with:
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive testing
- Security best practices
- Performance optimizations
- Operational tooling

Remember to:
- Start with a small batch of leads to verify everything works
- Monitor closely for the first 48 hours
- Have a rollback plan ready
- Keep the team informed of deployment progress

Good luck with your production launch! 🚀
