# LeadFactory Local Docker Deployment Status

## Deployment Successful ✅

The LeadFactory application has been successfully deployed to your local Docker environment.

### Running Services

| Service | Status | Port | Description |
|---------|--------|------|-------------|
| leadfactory-api | ✅ Running | 8000 | Main API server |
| leadfactory-postgres | ✅ Healthy | 5432 | PostgreSQL database |
| leadfactory-redis | ✅ Healthy | 6379 | Redis cache |
| leadfactory-prometheus | ✅ Healthy | 9091 | Metrics collection |
| leadfactory-nginx | ✅ Healthy | 80, 443 | Reverse proxy |

### Access Points

- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health
- **Application (via Nginx)**: http://localhost/
- **Prometheus Metrics**: http://localhost:9091/

### Configuration

- Environment: Production
- Using Stub APIs: Yes (for local testing)
- Database: PostgreSQL 15
- Cache: Redis 7

### Known Issues

1. **Database Migrations**: The analytics views migrations contain PostgreSQL-specific SQL that doesn't work with SQLite. This is a non-critical issue for local testing with stubs.

2. **Grafana**: Not started due to port conflict on 3001. Can be configured to use a different port if needed.

### Quick Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down

# Restart a service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml restart <service-name>

# Execute commands in API container
docker exec leadfactory-api <command>

# Check service status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep leadfactory
```

### Testing the Deployment

```bash
# Test API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test through Nginx
curl http://localhost/health

# Run validation tests
python3 scripts/validate_production.py

# Run minimal tests
docker run --rm -e USE_STUBS=true leadfactory-test python scripts/run_minimal_test.py
```

### Next Steps

1. **Real API Keys**: Update `.env.production` with real API keys when ready to use actual services
2. **SSL Certificates**: Add SSL certificates in `nginx/ssl/` for HTTPS
3. **Monitoring**: Access Prometheus at http://localhost:9091 for metrics
4. **Scaling**: Adjust resource limits in docker-compose.production.yml as needed

The system is now running and ready for local testing!
