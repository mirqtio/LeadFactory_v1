# Archive Directory

This directory contains files that are not needed for day-to-day development but are kept for reference.

## Structure

- **testing/** - Test results and test-related files
- **documentation/** - Historical documentation, summaries, and guides
- **analysis/** - Gap analysis and remediation documents
- **misc/** - Miscellaneous files (archives, logs, etc.)

## Note

These files are archived to keep the root directory clean and organized. They can be referenced when needed but are not part of the active codebase.
