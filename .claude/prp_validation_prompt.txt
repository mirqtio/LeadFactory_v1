You are validating a PRP (Project Requirements Plan) implementation. 

CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. Code Implementation:
   - All required functionality is implemented
   - Code follows the patterns and conventions in CLAUDE.md
   - Tests are written and passing locally

2. Git Status:
   - All changes are committed to git
   - Changes are pushed to GitHub main branch
   - Verify by checking GitHub repository

3. CI/CD Status (MOST IMPORTANT):
   - Check GitHub Actions for the repository
   - ALL workflows must show GREEN checkmarks
   - This includes:
     * Test Suite - MUST BE PASSING
     * Docker Build - MUST BE PASSING  
     * Linting and Code Quality - MUST BE PASSING
     * Deploy to VPS - MUST BE PASSING
     * Minimal Test Suite - MUST BE PASSING
   - If ANY workflow is failing, the PRP is NOT complete

4. Validation Steps:
   - Use the GitHub API with the token in .env to check workflow status
   - Get the latest workflow runs for the main branch
   - Verify every single workflow has conclusion: "success"
   - If any workflow has conclusion: "failure", report validation FAILED

IMPORTANT: A PRP is ONLY complete when ALL CI checks are passing. Partial success is NOT success.

Report format:
- Implementation: ✅/❌
- Git Status: ✅/❌  
- CI Status: ✅/❌ (list each workflow and its status)
- Overall: PASS/FAIL (PASS only if everything above is ✅)
