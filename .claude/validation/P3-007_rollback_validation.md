# P3-007 Rollback Validation & Recovery Procedures

## Overview
Comprehensive rollback validation and recovery procedures for Docker CI test execution implementation.

## Rollback Strategy Framework

### 1. Rollback Scenarios
**Primary Rollback Triggers**:
- Performance degradation > 50% from baseline
- Test reliability drops below 95% success rate
- Critical CI failures preventing deployments
- Resource exhaustion in GitHub Actions runners
- Security vulnerabilities in Docker implementation

### 2. Rollback Decision Matrix
```yaml
severity_levels:
  critical:
    trigger: "CI completely broken, blocking all deployments"
    action: "Immediate rollback within 1 hour"
    approval: "Single maintainer"
  
  high:
    trigger: "Performance degradation > 50%, test failures > 5%"
    action: "Rollback within 24 hours"
    approval: "Team lead approval"
  
  medium:
    trigger: "Performance degradation 20-50%, minor test instability"
    action: "Rollback within 1 week"
    approval: "Team consensus"
  
  low:
    trigger: "Minor performance issues, cosmetic problems"
    action: "Fix forward or rollback in next sprint"
    approval: "Team discretion"
```

## Pre-Rollback Validation

### 1. System State Assessment
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-rollback assessment script
echo "=== P3-007 Pre-Rollback Assessment ==="

# Check current CI status
echo "Current CI Status:"
gh run list --limit 10 --json conclusion,status,startedAt,updatedAt

# Performance metrics
echo "Performance Metrics:"
scripts/benchmark_current_performance.sh

# Resource utilization
echo "Resource Utilization:"
docker system df
docker system events --since 1h --until now

# Test reliability
echo "Test Reliability (Last 10 runs):"
gh run list --limit 10 --json conclusion | jq '.[] | .conclusion' | sort | uniq -c
```

### 2. Impact Analysis
- **Deployment Impact**: Assess effect on ongoing deployments
- **Developer Experience**: Evaluate impact on development workflow
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure test coverage maintained during rollback
- **Data Loss Risk**: Identify any data that might be lost

### 3. Rollback Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Backup current configuration files
- [ ] Document current state and performance metrics
- [ ] Identify rollback commit hash
- [ ] Verify rollback environment compatibility
- [ ] Prepare rollback communication plan

## Rollback Execution Procedures

### 1. Configuration Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous CI configuration
# 1. Identify last stable commit
LAST_STABLE_COMMIT=$(git log --oneline --grep="P3-007" | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f1)
echo "Last stable commit: $LAST_STABLE_COMMIT"

# 2. Create rollback branch
git checkout -b rollback-p3-007-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git revert --no-edit $LAST_STABLE_COMMIT

# 3. Rollback key files
git checkout $LAST_STABLE_COMMIT -- .github/workflows/ci.yml
git checkout $LAST_STABLE_COMMIT -- docker-compose.test.yml
git checkout $LAST_STABLE_COMMIT -- Dockerfile.test
git checkout $LAST_STABLE_COMMIT -- scripts/run_docker_tests.sh
```

### 2. Gradual Rollback Strategy
```yaml
rollback_phases:
  phase_1:
    name: "Disable Docker test execution"
    action: "Revert to direct pytest execution"
    files: [".github/workflows/ci.yml"]
    validation: "Verify CI passes with direct execution"
  
  phase_2:
    name: "Remove Docker test infrastructure"
    action: "Remove Docker-specific configurations"
    files: ["docker-compose.test.yml", "Dockerfile.test"]
    validation: "Verify no Docker dependencies remain"
  
  phase_3:
    name: "Restore original test scripts"
    action: "Revert test execution scripts"
    files: ["scripts/run_docker_tests.sh"]
    validation: "Verify original test workflow restored"
```

### 3. Emergency Rollback Procedure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency rollback script
echo "=== EMERGENCY P3-007 ROLLBACK ==="

# 1. Stop all current CI jobs
gh run cancel --repo $GITHUB_REPOSITORY $(gh run list --limit 10 --json databaseId -q '.[].databaseId')

# 2. Revert to last known good state
git checkout main
git revert --no-edit HEAD~1  # Assuming last commit was P3-007

# 3. Force push (emergency only)
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# 4. Verify rollback
gh run list --limit 1 --json conclusion
```

## Post-Rollback Validation

### 1. Functionality Verification
```bash
# Post-rollback validation script
echo "=== Post-Rollback Validation ==="

# 1. Verify CI pipeline works
gh workflow run ci.yml
sleep 60
gh run list --limit 1 --json conclusion

# 2. Test local development workflow
make quick-check
make pre-push

# 3. Verify test coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

# 4. Check performance baseline
scripts/benchmark_performance.sh
```

### 2. System Health Checks
- [ ] CI pipeline executes successfully
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable range
- [ ] No resource leaks or orphaned processes
- [ ] Developer workflow unaffected

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
```yaml
post_rollback_monitoring:
  metrics:
    - ci_success_rate
    - test_execution_time
    - resource_utilization
    - error_rates
  
  alerts:
    - condition: "ci_success_rate < 95%"
      action: "Immediate investigation"
    - condition: "test_execution_time > baseline + 50%"
      action: "Performance analysis"
    - condition: "error_rate > 1%"
      action: "Root cause analysis"
```

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Forward Recovery Strategy
```bash
# Forward recovery approach
# 1. Identify root cause
echo "Analyzing root cause of P3-007 issues..."
git log --oneline --grep="P3-007" | head -10

# 2. Create fix branch
git checkout -b fix-p3-007-issues

# 3. Apply targeted fixes
# Fix specific issues without full rollback
git cherry-pick --no-commit $FIX_COMMIT

# 4. Incremental deployment
# Deploy fixes incrementally with validation
```

### 2. Hybrid Recovery Approach
```yaml
hybrid_recovery:
  phase_1:
    name: "Partial rollback"
    action: "Rollback problematic components only"
    keep: ["Docker infrastructure", "Service configurations"]
    revert: ["Test execution logic", "Performance optimizations"]
  
  phase_2:
    name: "Incremental fixes"
    action: "Apply fixes to rolled-back components"
    validate: "Each fix independently tested"
    deploy: "Gradual rollout with monitoring"
  
  phase_3:
    name: "Full recovery"
    action: "Restore all P3-007 functionality"
    validate: "Comprehensive testing"
    monitor: "Extended monitoring period"
```

### 3. Recovery Validation Framework
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Recovery validation script
echo "=== P3-007 Recovery Validation ==="

# 1. Validate core functionality
if ! make quick-check; then
    echo "❌ Core functionality broken"
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Validate Docker implementation
if ! docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm test; then
    echo "❌ Docker implementation broken"
    exit 1
fi

# 3. Validate performance
CURRENT_TIME=$(scripts/benchmark_performance.sh | grep "Total Time" | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' s')
if [ "$CURRENT_TIME" -gt 300 ]; then
    echo "❌ Performance regression detected"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Recovery validation successful"
```
