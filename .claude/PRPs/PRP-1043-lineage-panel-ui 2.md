# PRP-1043 - Lineage Panel UI
**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 5 days
**Dependencies**: PRP-1037, PRP-1017

## Goal & Success Criteria
Create an advanced React-based lineage visualization interface that transforms the current basic HTML lineage panel into an interactive data flow visualization system with real-time audit trail capabilities and debugging features.

**Specific Measurable Outcomes:**
- Replace existing HTML lineage interface with React-based interactive visualization
- Implement real-time data flow diagrams using React Flow library
- Create comprehensive audit trail interface with timeline visualization
- Provide debugging tools for pipeline troubleshooting
- Achieve <500ms load times for complex lineage visualizations
- Reduce debugging workflow time by 60% compared to current interface

## Context & Background

**Current State:**
The existing lineage panel at `/static/lineage/index.html` provides basic HTML interface for viewing report generation lineage. It includes search functionality, statistics overview, and basic log viewing but lacks interactive visualization capabilities.

**Business Need:**
- Enhanced operational transparency for faster debugging of report generation issues
- Visual representation of data flow dependencies for complex pipeline troubleshooting  
- Real-time audit trail capabilities for compliance and monitoring
- Improved user experience for technical staff debugging production issues

**Technical Context:**
- Existing lineage API endpoints at `/api/lineage` provide comprehensive data access
- Current HTML interface lacks visual relationships between data transformations
- React ecosystem provides superior tooling for interactive data visualization
- React Flow library offers production-ready node-based diagram capabilities

**Integration Points:**
- Builds upon existing lineage API endpoints (/api/lineage) 
- Integrates with current audit trail database models
- Maintains compatibility with existing authentication and authorization systems
- Extends current navigation shell for seamless user experience

## Technical Approach

**Architecture Overview:**
React-based single-page application using TypeScript and Vite build system, replacing the existing HTML interface while maintaining API compatibility.

**Key Components:**
1. **Interactive Data Flow Visualization**
   - React Flow library for node-based pipeline visualization
   - Custom nodes for pipeline stages (assessment, enrichment, scoring, report generation)
   - Real-time WebSocket connections for live pipeline status updates
   - Auto-layout algorithms for optimal graph presentation

2. **Enhanced Audit Trail Interface**  
   - Timeline-based audit log with filtering and search capabilities
   - User attribution display with role-based access indicators
   - Export functionality for compliance reporting
   - Real-time audit log streaming interface

3. **Advanced Debugging Features**
   - JSON log viewer with syntax highlighting and collapsible sections
   - Performance metrics visualization (pipeline duration, data size)
   - Error highlighting and root cause analysis tools
   - Comparative analysis between successful and failed pipeline runs

4. **Responsive Dashboard Layout**
   - Statistics overview with real-time metrics
   - Multi-panel layout supporting concurrent workflow analysis
   - Mobile-responsive design for field debugging scenarios

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18.2+ with TypeScript for type safety
- React Flow 11.8+ for interactive diagrams
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Interactive Visualization Requirements**
   - Interactive lineage visualization loads within 500ms for complex pipelines
   - Node-based diagram shows complete report generation pipeline stages
   - Expandable nodes display transformation details and data metrics
   - Visual connection lines show data flow dependencies accurately

2. **Real-time Functionality**
   - Real-time audit trail updates with <100ms latency via WebSocket
   - Live highlighting of active pipeline stages during execution
   - Automatic refresh of statistics and metrics without page reload

3. **User Experience Standards**
   - Visual regression testing passes for all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) verified via automated testing
   - Mobile-responsive design works on devices 320px+ width
   - User can trace complete data lineage path in <30 seconds for any report ID

4. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Bundle size <2MB total, initial load <3s on 3G networks
   - Coverage ≥90% on new React components and visualization logic
   - Debug workflow completion time reduced by 60% compared to current HTML interface

5. **Integration Requirements**
   - Seamless integration with existing `/api/lineage` endpoints
   - Maintains compatibility with current authentication and authorization
   - Navigation integration with global navigation shell
   - Feature flag support for gradual rollout

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- PRP-1037 (Navigation Shell) - Required for navigation integration
- PRP-1017 (Lineage Panel API) - Required for API endpoints and data structures

**Technical Dependencies:**
- React ^18.2.0 (UI framework with concurrent features)
- React Flow ^11.8.0 (Interactive node-based diagrams)
- TypeScript ^5.0.0 (Type safety and developer experience)

- eslint, prettier (Code quality and formatting)

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing:**
- React Testing Library for component behavior verification
- Jest for utility functions and custom hooks
- Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API endpoint mocking

## Rollback Plan

**Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes):**
- Feature flag `ENABLE_REACT_LINEAGE_UI=false` disables new interface
- Existing HTML interface at `/static/lineage/index.html` serves as fallback
- No database changes required - purely frontend enhancement
- CDN rollback via deployment pipeline restores previous static files

**Gradual Rollout Strategy:**
- Phase 1: Deploy to staging environment for internal testing
- Phase 2: Enable for admin users only via role-based feature flags  
- Phase 3: Gradual rollout to 25%, 50%, 100% of users with monitoring
- Rollback trigger: >5% increase in error rates or user complaints

**Data Consistency:**
- No database migrations required for this frontend enhancement
- Existing lineage data remains fully accessible via current API
- Audit trail continues functioning regardless of interface choice

**Monitoring and Alerts:**
- Real-time performance monitoring during rollout
- User experience metrics tracking (load times, error rates)
- Automated rollback if critical thresholds exceeded
