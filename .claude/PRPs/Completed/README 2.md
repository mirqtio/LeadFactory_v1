# Completed PRPs - File Organization

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-20  
**Files Organized**: 30/32 completed PRPs  
**Naming Convention**: `{STABLE_ID}_{LEGACY_ID}_{TITLE}.md`

## Organization Summary

This folder contains all Project Requirement Plan (PRP) files that have been **verified as complete** through implementation evidence and moved from the main PRPs directory.

### File Naming Convention

**Format**: `PRP-NNNN_P#-###_Title.md`
- **Stable ID**: PRP-1001 through PRP-1032 (stable identity)
- **Legacy ID**: Original priority-based ID (P0-001, P1-010, etc.)
- **Title**: Descriptive name with underscores

**Example**: `PRP-1001_P0-001_Fix_D4_Coordinator.md`

## Completed Files by Priority

### P0 Must-Have Completed (20 files)
- PRP-1001 through PRP-1020: Infrastructure + Core business features

### P1 Should-Have Completed (8 files)  
- PRP-1021 through PRP-1028: Enhancement features

### P2 Could-Have Completed (1 file)
- PRP-1030: Analytics features (Unit Economics Views)

### P3 Won't-Have-Now Completed (1 file)
- PRP-1032: Critical fixes (Lead Explorer Audit Trail)

## Missing Files (2/32)

**Not Found During Organization**:
1. **P2-000**: Account Management Module
2. **P2-020**: Unit Economics PDF Section

**Reason**: These PRPs may not have had separate PRP files created, or were implemented directly without formal PRP documentation.

## File Organization Benefits

### Before Organization
- Mixed completed and incomplete PRPs in same directory
- Difficult to distinguish completion status from filename
- No stable identity for file references

### After Organization
- Clear separation of completed vs remaining PRPs
- Stable ID + Legacy ID for easy reference
- Organized by completion status for better navigation

## Reference Links

- **Tracking System**: `.claude/prp_tracking/prp_status.yaml`
- **Completed Documentation**: `COMPLETED_STABLE_IDS.md`
- **Stable ID Mapping**: `.claude/STABLE_ID_MAPPING.md`
- **Remaining PRPs**: `INITIAL_STABLE_IDS.md`

## Usage Notes

### File References
- **Primary**: Use stable ID (PRP-1001) for permanent references
- **Legacy**: Legacy ID (P0-001) maintained for backward compatibility
- **Documentation**: Include both stable and legacy IDs in references

### Evidence Validation
All files in this folder represent PRPs with verified implementation evidence:
- Working code in repository
- Database migrations completed
- Tests passing
- CI/CD validation successful

**Organization Status**: âœ… Complete (30/32 files organized)  
**Next Action**: Create missing PRP files for P2-000 and P2-020 if needed
