# P0-016 - Test Suite Stabilization and Performance Optimization
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 5 days
**Dependencies**: P0-015

## Goal & Success Criteria
Achieve 100% stable test suite with zero flaky tests, optimized performance under 5 minutes, and systematic test management to prevent future regressions.

### Success Criteria
1. Zero flaky tests - all tests pass consistently across 10 consecutive runs
2. Test suite completes in <5 minutes total runtime
3. Pre-push validation (`make pre-push`) completes without timeout
4. No test collection errors or import warnings
5. Coverage maintained at ≥80% (current baseline from P0-015)
6. All Pydantic v2 incompatibilities resolved (`regex` → `pattern` migrations)
7. Test categorization system fully implemented and documented
8. CI workflows optimized with proper parallelization

## Context & Background
**Business value**: A stable test suite is foundational to all development work. Flaky tests erode confidence, slow development velocity, and mask real issues. Performance problems in validation hooks block commits and reduce developer productivity.

**Current State**: 
- Test suite times out at 2 minutes
- 179 xfail markers across 282 test files
- 10 collection errors from Pydantic v2 incompatibilities
- No systematic test categorization
- Pre-push validation frequently times out

**Impact**: This must be solved systematically rather than with tactical fixes. Without a stable test suite, all future development is at risk.

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Immediate Blockers (Day 1)
1. Mass update all Pydantic field definitions: `regex=` → `pattern=`
2. Fix import errors in ignored test files
3. Resolve pytest collection warnings
4. Establish baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Implement Test Categorization (Day 2)
1. Add systematic markers: `@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, etc.
2. Create marker inheritance rules in conftest.py
3. Document categorization policies
4. Update CI to run categories separately

### Phase 3: Optimize Performance (Day 3)
1. Profile slow tests and add `@pytest.mark.slow` markers
2. Implement test parallelization with `pytest-xdist`
3. Create separate CI jobs for different test categories
4. Add database connection pooling for integration tests

### Phase 4: Eliminate Flaky Tests (Day 4)
1. Run diagnostic script to identify flaky tests over 10 runs
2. Fix race conditions and timing issues
3. Implement proper async test utilities
4. Add retry logic only where network calls are involved

### Phase 5: Infrastructure & Documentation (Day 5)
1. Create centralized fixture system
2. Implement database transaction rollback for test isolation
3. Add performance regression detection
4. Document all changes and best practices

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Collection Success**: `pytest --collect-only` shows zero errors (currently 10 errors)
2. **Performance Target**: Full test suite runs in <5 minutes (currently times out at 2 minutes)
3. **Stability**: 10 consecutive full test runs with zero failures
4. **Pre-push Validation**: `make pre-push` completes without timeout
5. **Coverage Maintained**: Test coverage stays ≥80% (baseline from P0-015)
6. **Pydantic Compatibility**: All `regex=` replaced with `pattern=` in field definitions
7. **Test Categories**: All tests properly marked with category markers
8. **CI Optimization**: Parallel execution reduces CI time by >50%
9. **Documentation**: Test best practices guide created
10. **Monitoring**: Performance regression alerts configured

## Dependencies

**Task Dependencies**:
- P0-015 (Test Coverage Enhancement to 80%) - Must maintain coverage baseline

**Package Dependencies**:
- `pytest>=7.4.0` - Latest pytest with improved parallelization
- `pytest-xdist>=3.3.0` - Parallel test execution
- `pytest-timeout>=2.1.0` - Prevent hanging tests
- `pytest-benchmark>=4.0.0` - Performance regression detection
- `pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0` - Async test support
- `pytest-mock>=3.11.0` - Improved mocking utilities

**Infrastructure Dependencies**:
- GitHub Actions runners with sufficient resources
- PostgreSQL test database with connection pooling
- Stub server for external API mocking

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types
1. **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated, no external dependencies
2. **Integration Tests**: Database/API interactions, proper cleanup
3. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks, separate CI job
4. **Smoke Tests**: Critical path only, <30 seconds total
5. **Flaky Test Detection**: Automated 10-run validation

### Coverage Requirements
- Overall: ≥80% (maintain P0-015 baseline)
- New code: ≥90% coverage required
- Critical paths: 100% coverage required

### CI Strategy
- **PR Tests**: Unit + smoke tests only (<2 minutes)
- **Main Branch**: Full test suite with all categories
- **Nightly**: Performance regression tests
- **Weekly**: Flaky test detection runs

## Rollback Plan

### Conditions for Rollback
1. Test coverage drops below 75%
2. CI time increases beyond 10 minutes
3. New flaky tests introduced
4. Critical business logic tests fail

### Rollback Steps
1. `git revert` the PR containing changes
2. Restore original `pytest.ini` and `conftest.py`
3. Re-enable xfail markers for known failing tests
4. Document lessons learned in `tests/ROLLBACK_NOTES.md`
5. Create follow-up tickets for unresolved issues

### Data Preservation
- Keep diagnostic logs from failed attempt
- Preserve performance profiling data
- Maintain list of identified flaky tests
- Archive test timing statistics

## Validation Framework

### Pre-Implementation Checks
- [ ] Current test metrics baselined
- [ ] Flaky tests identified and documented
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks profiled
- [ ] Pydantic migration scope confirmed

### Implementation Validation
- [ ] Daily progress against acceptance criteria
