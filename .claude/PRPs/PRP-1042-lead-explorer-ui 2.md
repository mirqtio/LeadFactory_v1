## Context & Background
The current Lead Explorer consists of a static HTML mockup (`/static/lead_explorer/index.html`) with JavaScript-based interactions but no real data integration. The existing FastAPI backend (`/lead_explorer/api.py`) provides comprehensive CRUD operations, search functionality, and badge management through well-defined REST endpoints. The LeadFactory business model relies on efficient lead management workflows to support the $399 launch pricing and sales team productivity requirements.

The application needs to transition from a mockup to a production-ready interface that can handle large datasets (1000+ leads), provide real-time updates, and maintain accessibility standards while integrating seamlessly with the existing backend architecture and design system.

## Technical Approach

### Integration Points
- **Lead Explorer API** (`/lead_explorer/api.py`): REST endpoints for CRUD operations, search, and badge management
- **Design System** (`/static/design_system/design_system.css`): CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- **Account Management** (`/account_management/`): Authentication and authorization integration
- **Database Models** (`/lead_explorer/models.py`): Lead and badge data structures
- **Audit System** (`/lead_explorer/audit.py`): Action logging and compliance tracking

### Implementation Approach
1. **Project Setup**: Initialize React with TypeScript, Vite build system, and design token integration
2. **Data Grid Implementation**: 
   - Use Material React Table or AG Grid for enterprise-grade data grid functionality
   - Implement virtual scrolling for performance with large datasets
   - Add sorting, filtering, and pagination capabilities
3. **API Integration**:
   - Create TypeScript API client with proper type definitions
   - Implement async data fetching with error handling and loading states
   - Add optimistic updates for improved user experience
4. **Form Management**:
   - Use React Hook Form for validation and form state management
   - Implement real-time validation with Zod schemas matching backend Pydantic models
   - Add accessibility features for form inputs and error messages
5. **State Management**:
   - Use Zustand or React Query for global state and API caching
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSocket connections for enrichment status
   - Add offline capability with service worker for basic functionality
6. **Accessibility Implementation**:
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
   - Implement keyboard navigation and screen reader support
   - Add focus management and skip links for efficient navigation
7. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for components using React Testing Library
   - Integration tests for API interactions and user workflows
   - E2E tests for critical user journeys using Playwright
   - Accessibility testing with axe-core automated checks

### Error Handling Strategy
- **API Errors**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages and retry mechanisms
- **Validation Errors**: Real-time validation with clear error indicators and guidance
- **Network Failures**: Offline support with local caching and sync when connection restored
- **Component Errors**: Error boundaries with fallback UI and error reporting

### Performance Optimization
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Handle 1000+ records without performance degradation
- **Lazy Loading**: Load data on-demand with infinite scroll pagination
- **Debounced Search**: Reduce API calls with 300ms debounce on search input
- **Memoization**: Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- **Bundle Splitting**: Code splitting for optimal initial load time

## Acceptance Criteria
1. React-based Lead Explorer renders and displays lead data grid with virtual scrolling capability
2. Search functionality responds within 500ms and provides autocomplete suggestions
3. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) function correctly with proper validation
4. Bulk actions support multi-select operations for 100+ leads without performance issues
5. Badge management allows assignment/removal with role-based permission validation
6. Accessibility compliance achieves ≥90% score using axe-core automated testing
7. Mobile responsive design functions on devices with ≥320px width
8. API integration maintains <200ms response times for standard operations
9. Design token compliance verified through automated validation
10. Test coverage meets ≥80% unit tests and ≥70% integration tests

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: React Testing Library for component testing, Jest for utilities and hooks
- **Integration Testing**: API integration tests using pytest for backend endpoints
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for complete user journey validation
- **Accessibility Testing**: axe-core automated checks and manual screen reader testing
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse audits and Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **Visual Regression**: Percy or Chromatic for design consistency validation

## Validation Framework

### Executable Tests
```bash
# Syntax/Style
cd /static/lead_explorer && npm run lint && npm run type-check

# Unit Tests
cd /static/lead_explorer && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Integration Tests  
pytest tests/integration/test_lead_explorer_ui.py -v

# E2E Tests
cd /static/lead_explorer && npm run test:e2e

# Accessibility Tests
cd /static/lead_explorer && npm run test:a11y

# Backend API Tests
pytest tests/unit/lead_explorer/ -v -m "not slow"
```

### Missing-Checks Validation
**Required for UI/Frontend tasks:**
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, Stylelint)
- [ ] Branch protection & required status checks for React app
