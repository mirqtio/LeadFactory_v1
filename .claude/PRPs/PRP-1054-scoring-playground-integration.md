# PRP-1054 - Scoring Playground Integration

**Priority**: P2  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Effort**: 5 days  
**Dependencies**: PRP-1019

## Goal & Success Criteria
Enhance the existing Scoring Playground (PRP-1019) with advanced workflow integration, async scoring engine connectivity, and real-time collaboration features to create a comprehensive scoring experimentation platform.

## Context & Background  
- **Business value**: Enables data-driven scoring optimization through streamlined workflows, reducing scoring iteration cycles from hours to minutes and improving lead quality through rapid experimentation
- **Integration**: Leverages existing FastAPI async infrastructure and scoring engine to create seamless workflow between experimentation and production deployment
- **Problems solved**: Eliminates scoring workflow friction, provides real-time feedback loops, and enables collaborative scoring optimization across teams

Upgrade the current Scoring Playground with enhanced integration capabilities including:
- **Async scoring engine integration** for real-time scoring calculations using production algorithms
- **Real-time collaboration** with multi-user weight editing and live change broadcasting
- **Advanced validation pipeline** with comprehensive weight validation and impact analysis
- **Workflow automation** for seamless transition from experimentation to production deployment
- **Performance monitoring** with detailed scoring performance metrics and optimization insights

## Technical Approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Async Scoring Engine Integration**
   - Create AsyncScoringEngine adapter wrapping existing scoring engine
   - Implement connection pooling for high-performance concurrent scoring
   - Add caching layer for frequently accessed scoring configurations
   - Integrate with existing hot-reload system for dynamic configuration updates

2. **Real-time Collaboration System**
   - Implement WebSocket endpoints for live weight editing and change broadcasting
   - Create conflict resolution system for concurrent weight modifications
   - Add user presence indicators and change attribution tracking
   - Implement optimistic UI updates with server-side validation rollback

3. **Enhanced Validation Pipeline**
   - Extend current weight sum validation with comprehensive business rule validation
   - Add impact analysis showing predicted scoring distribution changes
   - Implement staging environment testing before production deployment
   - Create validation checkpoints with detailed error reporting and recommendations

4. **Workflow Automation**
   - Build automated testing pipeline for scoring configuration changes
   - Implement approval workflow for production scoring updates
   - Create rollback mechanisms for failed scoring deployments
   - Add notification system for workflow status updates and approvals

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement real-time scoring performance metrics collection
   - Create performance benchmarking against baseline configurations
   - Add alerting for performance regression detection
   - Build optimization recommendation engine based on performance patterns

### Integration Points
- **api/scoring_playground.py**: Extend with async engine integration and WebSocket endpoints
- **d5_scoring/engine.py**: Create async adapter for real-time scoring calculations
- **static/scoring-playground/index.html**: Enhance with WebSocket client for real-time collaboration
- **database/models.py**: Add workflow persistence models for experiment tracking
- **main.py**: Register new routers and WebSocket handlers for collaboration features
- **core/config.py**: Add configuration for async engine and collaboration settings

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Async scoring engine integration operational with <200ms response times
2. Real-time collaboration supporting ≥5 concurrent users with WebSocket connections
3. Advanced validation pipeline catching 100% of invalid configurations before deployment
4. Workflow automation reducing scoring deployment time from 30+ minutes to <5 minutes
5. Performance monitoring providing actionable insights for ≥95% of scoring experiments
6. Coverage ≥ 80% on enhanced integration features
7. Integration tests covering end-to-end workflows pass consistently
8. Production scoring engine compatibility verified through comprehensive testing

## Dependencies

**Required Dependencies**:
- PRP-1019 (Scoring Playground): COMPLETED - Base scoring playground implementation
- FastAPI 0.100+: Current async capabilities and WebSocket support
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+: Async database operations for workflow persistence
- Pydantic V2: Enhanced validation patterns for scoring pipeline

## Testing Strategy

### Test Framework Requirements
- **Unit tests**: pytest for all new async adapters and validation logic
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end workflow testing covering collaboration and deployment scenarios
- **Performance tests**: pytest-benchmark for concurrent user scenarios and scoring calculations
- **E2E tests**: Playwright browser automation for real-time collaboration features
- **WebSocket tests**: pytest-asyncio for WebSocket connection management and collaboration

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for all new integration features
- 100% coverage for critical async engine integration paths
- Performance regression testing for <200ms response time requirements
- Load testing for ≥5 concurrent collaboration users

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Strategy
1. **Feature flag**: Disable enhanced features via `core/config.py` settings
2. **Database rollback**: Revert workflow tables using Alembic down migrations
3. **API rollback**: Remove new endpoints while preserving existing scoring playground functionality
4. **UI rollback**: Revert static files to original scoring playground UI without collaboration features
5. **Scoring engine**: Ensure existing synchronous scoring operations remain unaffected
6. **Performance monitoring**: Disable monitoring features while preserving core scoring functionality

### Rollback Conditions
- Response time degradation >300ms for existing scoring operations
- WebSocket connection failures affecting >20% of users
- Data corruption in scoring configurations
- Critical security vulnerabilities in collaboration features

- [ ] API performance budgets (<200ms response time, <100ms WebSocket latency)
- [ ] Async pattern validation (connection pooling, resource cleanup)
- [ ] WebSocket connection management testing (reconnection, failover)

**Recommended:**
- [ ] Performance regression budgets (±10% scoring calculation time)
