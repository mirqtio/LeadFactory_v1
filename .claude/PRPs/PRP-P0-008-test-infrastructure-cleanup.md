# PRP: Test Infrastructure Cleanup

## Task ID: P0-008
## Wave: A

## Business Logic (Why This Matters)
Slow or mis-marked tests waste CI minutes and confuse signal.

## Overview
Fix test discovery and marking issues

## Dependencies
- P0-007

**Note**: Depends on P0-007 completing successfully in the same CI run.

## Outcome-Focused Acceptance Criteria
Collect phase shows correct counts; `pytest -m slow` runs 0 tests in CI; import errors in ignored files eliminated.

### Task-Specific Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Phase 0.5 tests auto-marked as xfail
- [ ] Slow tests excluded from PR builds
- [ ] Import errors in ignored files fixed
- [ ] Test collection time <5 seconds

### Additional Requirements
- [ ] Ensure overall test coverage ≥ 80% after implementation
- [ ] Update relevant documentation (README, docs/) if behavior changes
- [ ] No performance regression (merge operations remain O(n))
- [ ] Only modify files within specified integration points (no scope creep)

## Integration Points
- `conftest.py`
- `pytest.ini`
- CI workflow files

**Critical Path**: Only modify files within these directories. Any changes outside require a separate PRP.

## Tests to Pass
- `pytest --collect-only` shows correct test counts
- CI runs in <10 minutes
- `pytest -m "slow" -q` runs zero slow tests in CI



## Example File/Pattern
**Test infrastructure cleanup**

## Reference Documentation
`pytest -m "slow" -q` runs **zero** slow tests in CI; import errors in ignored files are gone.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Verify Dependencies
- Check `.claude/prp_progress.json` to ensure all dependencies show "completed"
- Verify CI is green before starting

### Step 2: Set Up Environment
- Python version must be 3.11.0 (check with `python --version`)
- Docker must be running for infrastructure tasks
- Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Set `USE_STUBS=true` for local development

### Step 3: Implementation
1. Review the business logic and acceptance criteria
2. Study the example code/file pattern
3. Implement changes following CLAUDE.md standards
4. Ensure no deprecated features (see CURRENT_STATE.md below)

### Step 4: Testing
- Run all tests listed in "Tests to Pass" section
- Verify KEEP suite remains green
- Check coverage hasn't decreased

### Step 5: Validation
- All outcome-focused criteria must be demonstrably true
- Run full validation command suite
- Commit with descriptive message: `fix(P0-008): Test Infrastructure Cleanup`

## Validation Commands
```bash
# Run specific tests for this task
pytest `pytest --collect-only` shows correct test counts CI runs in <10 minutes `pytest -m "slow" -q` runs zero slow tests in CI -xvs

# Verify no existing tests broken
pytest -m "not phase_future and not slow" -q

# Check coverage meets Wave A requirement
coverage run -m pytest tests/unit
coverage report --fail-under=80

# Lint-level compile check
python -m py_compile $(git ls-files "*.py")
```

## Rollback Strategy
**Rollback**: Revert conftest.py and pytest.ini changes

## Feature Flag Requirements
No new feature flag required - this fix is unconditional.

## Success Criteria
- All specified tests passing
- Outcome-focused acceptance criteria verified
- Coverage ≥ 80% maintained
- CI green after push
- No performance regression

## Critical Context

### From CLAUDE.md (Project Instructions)
```markdown
🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code. If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility. For agents this looks like:
agent.py - Main agent definition and execution logic
tools.py - Tool functions used by the agent
prompts.py - System prompts
Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages).
Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages).
Use python_dotenv and load_env() for environment variables.
🧪 Testing & Reliability
Always create Pytest unit tests for new features (functions, classes, routes, etc).
After updating any logic, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
Tests should live in a /tests folder mirroring the main app structure.
Include at least:
1 test for expected use
1 edge case
1 failure case
✅ Task Completion
Mark completed tasks in TASK.md immediately after finishing them.
Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to TASK.md under a “Discovered During Work” section.
📎 Style & Conventions
Use Python as the primary language.
Follow PEP8, use type hints, and format with black.
Use pydantic for data validation.
Use FastAPI for APIs and SQLAlchemy or SQLModel for ORM if applicable.
Write docstrings for every function using the Google style:
def example():
    """
    Brief summary.

    Args:
        param1 (type): Description.

    Returns:
        type: Description.
    """
📚 Documentation & Explainability
Update README.md when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
Comment non-obvious code and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
When writing complex logic, add an inline # Reason: comment explaining the why, not just the what.
🧠 AI Behavior Rules
Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.
Never hallucinate libraries or functions – only use known, verified Python packages.
Always confirm file paths and module names exist before referencing them in code or tests.
Never delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task 
```

# Current State vs Original PRD — LeadFactory MVP

*(Updated 11 Jul 2025)*

---

## Executive Summary

The original Phase-0 PRDs (June 2025) assumed **Yelp-centric sourcing**, a **single-host Mac-Mini deployment**, and **minimal cost controls**. During July we pivoted to:

* **Remove Yelp entirely** in favour of purchased firmographic data + Google Business Profile (GBP).
* **Container-first infrastructure** (Docker, GitHub Actions, Ubuntu VPS).
* **Two-wave delivery plan**

  * **Wave A (P0)** – stabilise existing code, green the KEEP tests, dockerise CI, deploy app + Postgres container to the VPS.
  * **Wave B (P1/P2)** – add SEMrush, Lighthouse, Visual-rubric, LLM audits and full cost-ledger / guardrails.

- **Wave B**: >95% coverage on all new code (target)
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage required (payment, email delivery)
- **Integration tests**: Must pass in Docker, not just locally

# Wave A flags (core functionality)
USE_STUBS = True  # False in production
ENABLE_EMAILS = True  # Core feature

# Wave B flags (progressive rollout)
ENABLE_SEMRUSH = False  # Wave B
ENABLE_LIGHTHOUSE = False  # Wave B
ENABLE_VISUAL_ANALYSIS = False  # Wave B
ENABLE_LLM_AUDIT = False  # Wave B
ENABLE_COST_TRACKING = False  # Until P1-050
USE_DATAAXLE = False  # Until negotiated

# Guardrail flags
ENABLE_COST_GUARDRAILS = False  # P1-060
DAILY_BUDGET_CAP = 100.00  # USD
PER_LEAD_CAP = 2.50  # USD
```

| DataAxle API | Negotiating | Use mock until contract |
| SEMrush API | Have key | Implement in Wave B |
| Humanloop | Active | Already integrated |
| ScreenshotOne | Have account | Wire up in Wave B |
| OpenAI | Active | Manage costs carefully |
| SendGrid | Active | Add compliance headers |
| Stripe | Test mode | Move to live for launch |
| Supabase | Evaluating | Decision before P2-050 |

---

## LLM & Prompt-Management

*All production prompts managed in **Humanloop**; deterministic stubs used in tests.*

## Quick PRD Validation Guide

When reading PRD.md, ask:
1. Does it mention Yelp? → **Invalid**
2. Does it assume Mac Mini? → **Invalid**
3. Does it filter to 10%? → **Invalid** (analyze 100%)
4. Does it use $199 pricing? → **Invalid** (use $399)
5. Does it use basic templates? → **Invalid** (use LLM)
6. Is it about domain architecture? → **Likely Valid**
7. Is it about database schema? → **Check migrations first**
8. Is it about external APIs? → **Check current providers**
9. Is it about testing strategy? → **Mostly Valid**
10. Is it about orchestration patterns? → **Valid**

---

## Open Questions

1. **Supabase vs RDS** — final call before P2-050.
2. **Which LLM tier** for audit & email to stay within cost cap.
3. **Pricing elasticity** — test \$399 vs \$299 vs usage-based?
4. **DataAxle contract** — timeline and final pricing?
5. **Compliance risk** — CAN-SPAM/GDPR for purchased lists?

This document serves as the single source of truth for what LeadFactory actually is today, superseding any conflicting information in the original PRD.
```

**IMPORTANT**: The CURRENT_STATE.md document above contains critical information about:
- Features that have been REMOVED (like Yelp integration)
- Current implementation decisions that differ from the original PRD
- The DO NOT IMPLEMENT section that must be respected
- Current provider status and what's actually being used

Always follow CURRENT_STATE.md when there's any conflict with older documentation.
