# P0-028 - Design System UI Foundations
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Effort**: 5 days
**Dependencies**: None

## Goal & Success Criteria
Establish a comprehensive, accessible, and scalable design system foundation for LeadFactory that provides consistent UI components, design tokens, theming capabilities, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliant patterns for all React applications.

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Design token system expanded with 50+ semantic tokens covering colors, typography, spacing, animation, and component-specific variants
- React component library with 25+ accessible components built with Emotion and TypeScript
- Theme provider supporting light/dark modes with runtime switching
- All components achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (verified with axe-core)
- Performance benchmarks: <100ms theme switching, <50kb bundle size impact
- Coverage ≥ 80% on component unit tests

## Context & Background
**Business Value**: Accelerates development velocity by 30-40% through reusable components, ensures brand consistency across all touchpoints, reduces design-to-development handoff time, and creates maintainable UI architecture for rapid feature development.

**Integration Context**: Forms the foundation layer for all existing and future React applications (personalization dashboard, lead explorer, template studio, scoring playground), enabling consistent user experience across the entire LeadFactory ecosystem.

**Problems Solved**: Eliminates inconsistent styling patterns, reduces accessibility debt, prevents design token sprawl, enables efficient theming/white-labeling, and provides comprehensive component library for rapid UI development.

## Technical Approach
Enhance and expand the existing design system foundation through a comprehensive, phased implementation:

### Core Foundation Components
1. **Enhanced Design Token System**: Expand existing tokens with semantic naming, component-specific tokens, and runtime theme switching
2. **React Component Library**: Build comprehensive, accessible component library using Emotion CSS-in-JS with TypeScript
3. **Theme Provider Architecture**: Implement robust theming system with light/dark mode support and runtime switching
4. **Accessibility Framework**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with automated testing and comprehensive keyboard navigation
5. **Documentation System**: Create comprehensive component documentation with live examples and usage guidelines

### Component Library Scope
- **Layout Components**: Grid, Container, Stack, Divider, Spacer
- **Typography Components**: Heading, Text, Code, Link with semantic variants
- **Form Components**: Input, Select, Textarea, Checkbox, Radio, Switch with validation states
- **Navigation Components**: Button, Link, Breadcrumb, Tabs, Pagination
- **Feedback Components**: Alert, Toast, Badge, Progress, Loading, Status indicators
- **Data Display**: Table, Card, List, Tag, Tooltip, Popover
- **Overlay Components**: Modal, Drawer, Dropdown, Menu

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Token Migration**: Convert `/design/design_tokens.json` to TypeScript with semantic naming and validation
2. **Theme Architecture**: Build ThemeProvider with React Context API and localStorage persistence
3. **Component Development**: Create accessible components using Emotion with comprehensive prop interfaces
4. **Testing Integration**: Implement automated accessibility testing with @axe-core/react and visual regression testing
5. **Documentation**: Build component documentation site with live examples and usage guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Design token system expanded with 50+ semantic tokens covering colors, typography, spacing, animation, and component-specific variants
2. React component library with 25+ accessible components built with Emotion and TypeScript  
3. Theme provider supporting light/dark modes with runtime switching
4. All components achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (verified with axe-core)
5. Automated accessibility testing integrated into CI pipeline
6. Component documentation site with live examples and prop documentation
7. Performance benchmarks: <100ms theme switching, <50kb bundle size impact
8. Coverage ≥ 80% on component unit tests
9. Visual regression testing suite for all components
10. Integration with existing personalization dashboard without breaking changes

## Dependencies
- **React**: ^18.2.0 (existing compatibility with personalization dashboard)
- **TypeScript**: ^5.0.0 (type safety and developer experience)
- **@emotion/react**: ^11.11.0 (CSS-in-JS styling solution)
- **@emotion/styled**: ^11.11.0 (styled component API)
- **@emotion/cache**: ^11.11.0 (styling performance optimization)
- **@axe-core/react**: ^4.8.0 (automated accessibility testing)
- **@testing-library/react**: ^14.0.0 (component testing utilities)
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: ^6.0.0 (DOM testing assertions)
- **@storybook/react**: ^7.0.0 (component documentation and development)
- **chromatic**: ^10.0.0 (visual regression testing)
- **bundlewatch**: ^0.3.3 (bundle size monitoring)

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for component behavior and prop validation
2. **Accessibility Testing**: @axe-core/react for automated WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation
3. **Visual Testing**: Chromatic for visual regression detection across all components
4. **Integration Testing**: Component integration with theme provider and existing applications
5. **Performance Testing**: Bundle analyzer and runtime performance metrics for theme switching
6. **Manual Testing**: Screen reader testing with NVDA/VoiceOver and keyboard navigation validation

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests: ≥80% coverage for all components
- Accessibility tests: 100% of components tested with axe-core
- Visual tests: All component variants and states covered
- Integration tests: Theme provider and personalization dashboard integration
- Performance tests: Theme switching <100ms, bundle size <50kb impact

## Rollback Plan
1. **Token Migration Rollback**: Keep existing CSS system parallel during migration with feature flag `design_system_enabled`
2. **Component Rollback**: Maintain CSS fallbacks for all components during transition period
3. **Theme Provider Rollback**: Graceful degradation to CSS custom properties if React context fails
4. **Integration Rollback**: Feature flag to disable design system integration in applications
5. **Build Failure Rollback**: Automated rollback to previous working version if CI fails
6. **Performance Regression Rollback**: Automatic rollback if bundle size exceeds 10% increase

### Rollback Triggers
- CI/CD pipeline failures for >2 consecutive builds
- Performance regression: bundle size increase >10% or theme switching >200ms
- Accessibility compliance failure: any component failing axe-core validation
- Integration issues: breaking changes in personalization dashboard or other applications
- Critical bugs: P0 issues affecting user experience or application functionality

## Validation Framework

### Executable Tests
```bash
# Syntax/Style
cd design_system && npm run lint && npm run type-check

# Unit Tests  
cd design_system && npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Accessibility Tests
cd design_system && npm run test:a11y

# Visual Regression Tests
cd design_system && npm run test:visual

# Build Validation
cd design_system && npm run build && npm run bundle-analysis

# Integration Tests
cd static/personalization_dashboard && npm run test:integration
```

### Missing-Checks Validation
**Required for UI/Frontend tasks:**
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier, accessibility linting)
- [ ] Branch protection & required status checks
- [ ] Visual regression & accessibility testing (axe-core, Chromatic)
- [ ] Style-guide enforcement (ESLint + design token validation)
- [ ] Bundle size monitoring (bundlewatch, webpack-bundle-analyzer)
- [ ] Component documentation validation (required props, examples)

**Recommended:**
- [ ] Performance regression budgets (Core Web Vitals monitoring)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing automation (Playwright)
- [ ] Design token sync validation (design-to-code consistency)
- [ ] Accessibility audit automation (Pa11y, WAVE)
