# PRP-P0-015 Test Coverage Enhancement to 80%

> 💡 **Claude Implementation Note**: Consider how task subagents can be used to execute portions of this task in parallel to improve efficiency and reduce overall completion time.

## Goal
Increase test coverage from 57% to 80% while maintaining CI runtime under 5 minutes through strategic test implementation, mock factories, and performance optimization.

## Why  
- **Business value**: Production readiness requires high test coverage to prevent regressions, ensure code quality, and maintain confidence in deployments
- **Integration**: Builds on P0-014 test suite re-enablement to enhance quality across all modules
- **Problems solved**: Low coverage in critical modules (gateway <40%, targeting <40%, batch runner), lack of mock factories, missing async test patterns

## What
Implement comprehensive test coverage improvements focusing on:
1. Critical low-coverage modules (gateway providers, targeting, batch runner)
2. Mock factory patterns for external dependencies
3. Async operation testing infrastructure
4. CI/CD coverage gates and reporting
5. Performance optimization to maintain <5min CI runtime

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Overall test coverage ≥80% (from current 57.37%)
- [ ] All modules with <40% coverage improved to ≥60%
- [ ] CI runtime remains under 5 minutes
- [ ] No flaky tests in 10 consecutive runs
- [ ] Coverage gates enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Mock factories implemented for all external services
- [ ] Async operations properly tested with coverage

## Technical Implementation

### Integration Points
- `tests/conftest.py` - Add global mock factories and async fixtures
- `.coveragerc` - Ensure fail_under=80 and proper async configuration
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Add coverage gates and reporting
- All modules with <40% coverage for targeted improvements
- `pytest.ini` - Optimize test discovery and execution

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Day 1)
1. Create mock factory framework in `tests/fixtures/`
   - Base mock factory class with common patterns
   - Provider-specific mock factories (OpenAI, SendGrid, etc.)
   - Async operation mock utilities
   - Response fixture generators

2. Configure coverage for async operations
   - Update .coveragerc with concurrency settings
   - Add gevent to dev dependencies
   - Configure pytest-asyncio with auto mode

3. Set up CI/CD coverage gates
   - Add --cov-fail-under=80 to pytest commands
   - Implement coverage trend tracking
   - Add PR comment reporting

#### Phase 2: Critical Module Coverage (Days 2-3)
1. Gateway Provider Tests (Target: 40% → 70%)
   - Mock all external API calls
   - Test error conditions and retries
   - Verify rate limiting and circuit breakers
   - Cover all provider-specific logic

2. Targeting Module Tests (Target: 40% → 70%)
   - Bucket operations with edge cases
   - Geo validation comprehensive tests
   - Quota tracking scenarios
   - Async batch scheduling tests

3. Batch Runner Tests (Target: 0% → 60%)
   - Core batch processing logic
   - Async operation handling
   - Error recovery and retries
   - Progress tracking and reporting

#### Phase 3: New Module Coverage (Day 4)
1. Lead Explorer Tests (Target: 0% → 80%)
   - Full CRUD operation coverage
   - API endpoint validation
   - Repository pattern tests
   - Integration with enrichment

#### Phase 4: Optimization & Validation (Day 5)
1. Performance Optimization
   - Implement test parallelization with pytest-xdist
   - Optimize slow tests with better mocks
   - Use test markers for selective execution
   - Cache test fixtures where appropriate

2. Flaky Test Elimination
   - Identify and fix timing-dependent tests
   - Improve async test stability
   - Add retry logic for external dependencies
   - Implement deterministic test data

### Error Handling Strategy
- Mock all external service failures
- Test timeout scenarios
- Verify retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cover all exception paths
- Test circuit breaker activation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Integration tests for module boundaries
- Parametrized tests for edge cases
- Property-based tests for complex logic
- Async tests for all concurrent operations

## Validation Gates

### Executable Tests
```bash
# Syntax/Style
ruff check --fix && mypy .

# Coverage Analysis
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Unit Tests with Coverage Gate
pytest tests/unit -v --cov --cov-fail-under=80

# Integration Tests
pytest tests/integration -v -m "not e2e"

# Performance Check
pytest tests/unit -v --durations=10

# Flaky Test Detection
pytest tests/unit -v --count=10 -x

# Module-Specific Coverage
pytest tests/unit/d0_gateway -v --cov=d0_gateway --cov-report=term-missing
pytest tests/unit/d1_targeting -v --cov=d1_targeting --cov-report=term-missing
pytest tests/unit/batch_runner -v --cov=batch_runner --cov-report=term-missing
pytest tests/unit/lead_explorer -v --cov=lead_explorer --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Missing-Checks Validation
**Required for CI/Testing tasks:**
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks updated with coverage checks
- [ ] Branch protection with required coverage status
- [ ] Automated coverage trend reporting
- [ ] Test performance regression detection
- [ ] Flaky test detection in CI
- [ ] Coverage comment bot on PRs

**Recommended:**
- [ ] Test categorization and selective execution
- [ ] Parallel test execution optimization
- [ ] Test fixture performance monitoring
- [ ] Mock usage analytics
- [ ] Coverage diff on pull requests

## Rollback Strategy
1. If coverage gates break CI:
   - Temporarily reduce fail_under threshold
   - Mark new tests as xfail
   - Revert to previous test configuration
   - Track failing tests for fix

2. If performance degrades:
   - Disable parallel execution
   - Skip slow tests with markers
   - Revert mock factory changes
   - Profile test execution

3. Emergency rollback:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD  # Revert coverage changes
   pytest tests/unit -v  # Verify tests still pass
   ```

## Feature Flag Requirements  
```yaml
# Test Execution Flags
TEST_COVERAGE_ENFORCEMENT: true      # Enforce 80% coverage gate
TEST_PARALLEL_EXECUTION: true        # Enable pytest-xdist
TEST_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING: true    # Track test execution time
TEST_FLAKY_DETECTION: true          # Enable flaky test detection

# Coverage Features
COVERAGE_PR_COMMENTS: true          # Post coverage to PRs
COVERAGE_TREND_TRACKING: true       # Track coverage over time
COVERAGE_MODULE_REPORTS: true       # Per-module coverage reports
```

## Performance Considerations
- Target: <5 minute CI runtime with full test suite
- Use pytest-xdist for parallel execution (4-8 workers)
- Implement test result caching for unchanged code
- Mock all external API calls to avoid network latency
- Use in-memory SQLite for database tests
- Profile and optimize slowest 10% of tests

## Security Considerations
- Never commit real API keys in test fixtures
- Mock all external service responses
- Sanitize test data to avoid PII
- Use separate test environments
- Implement secret scanning in CI

## Monitoring & Metrics
- Track coverage percentage over time
- Monitor test execution duration trends
- Alert on coverage drops >5%
- Report flaky test frequency
- Measure mock vs real call ratio
