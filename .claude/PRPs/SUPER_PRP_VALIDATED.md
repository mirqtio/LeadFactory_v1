# Super PRP - All Validated Tasks
Generated: 2025-01-12T10:30:00Z
Total Tasks: 34
Average Judge Score: 4.7/5

## Executive Summary

This Super PRP consolidates all 34 validated Product Requirements and Planning documents for the LeadFactory implementation. The tasks are organized into three waves:

- **Wave A (P0)**: 26 stabilization tasks focused on fixing the existing codebase, establishing CI/CD, and building core CPO console features
- **Wave B-P1**: 8 expansion tasks adding rich metrics providers (SEMrush, Lighthouse, Visual Analysis, LLM Audit) and cost controls  
- **Wave B-P2**: 4 unit economics and personalization tasks

All PRPs have passed the six-gate validation conveyor with an average Judge score of 4.7/5.

Wave B tasks (P1-*, P2-*) depend on ALL P0-* tasks being complete
```

### Suggested Implementation Order

1. **Foundation Phase** (P0-000 to P0-013): Sequential execution required
2. **Test & Quality Phase** (P0-014, P0-020): Can run in parallel after P0-013
3. **CPO Console Phase** (P0-021 to P0-026): Can run in parallel after P0-020
4. **Provider Integration Phase** (P1-010 to P1-080): Parallel execution possible
5. **Analytics Phase** (P2-010 to P2-040): Sequential within phase

### Resource Allocation

- **Critical Path**: P0-000 through P0-013 (must be sequential)
- **Parallelizable**: P0-021 through P0-026 (after dependencies met)
- **High Risk**: P0-003 (Dockerize CI), P0-011 (Deploy to VPS)
- **High Value**: P0-021 (Lead Explorer), P0-022 (Batch Report Runner)
