# Research Context for P0-027

## Key Findings
- React shell applications with micro-frontend architecture provide independent team velocity and technology diversity
- Module Federation (Webpack 5+) enables secure, scalable integration of independent React applications
- Authentication must be centralized in shell to prevent cross-cutting concerns and inconsistent logout flows
- Lazy loading with React.lazy() and Suspense provides optimal performance for large applications
- Route-based code splitting is the most effective approach for reducing initial bundle size
- Design tokens with Tailwind CSS custom properties enable consistent theming across micro-frontends

## Current Best Practices
- **Shell Architecture**: Container/shell app hosts micro-frontends, handles authentication, navigation, and shared services
- **Module Federation**: Webpack 5 Module Federation for runtime integration with shared dependencies (React, ReactDOM as singletons)
- **Authentication Strategy**: Centralized authentication in shell with shared session tokens and consistent logout flows
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based lazy loading using React.lazy() and Suspense for optimal performance
- **Navigation**: React Router in shell for cross-app navigation, individual micro-frontends handle internal routing
- **Design System**: Tailwind CSS with design tokens integrated via custom properties and configuration files
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries for failed module loads with graceful fallbacks

## Common Pitfalls
- **Authentication Inconsistency**: Baking authentication into each micro-frontend leads to inconsistent logout behavior
- **State Management**: Avoid shared runtime state between micro-frontends; use secure API communication
- **Bundle Duplication**: Must configure shared dependencies (React, ReactDOM) as singletons in Module Federation
- **Security**: Front-end route protection is UX-only; proper server-side authorization is essential
- **Performance**: Lazy loading chain can delay component loading after data fetches - consider preloading critical components
- **Network Failures**: Module loading failures need Error Boundaries for graceful degradation

## Recent Updates
- **Webpack 5**: Module Federation plugin enables micro-frontend architecture with shared dependencies
- **React Router 6.4+**: Data routers provide better code splitting integration but require careful lazy loading implementation
- **Tailwind 4 Beta**: CSS-based configuration replacing JavaScript configuration, improved custom properties support
- **React 18**: Concurrent features and Suspense improvements for better lazy loading experience
- **Vite Integration**: Modern build tools provide automatic code splitting and chunk optimization

## Implementation Recommendations
- **Architecture**: Shell app at `/app/*` routes with lazy-loaded micro-frontend modules
- **Authentication**: Integrate with existing P0-026 governance system for role-based access control
- **Routing**: Use React Router 6 with lazy loading and authentication guards for each route
- **Design System**: Implement design tokens from P0-020 with Tailwind CSS custom properties
- **Performance**: Bundle size limits (<250kb per micro-frontend), lazy loading with preloading for critical paths
- **Testing**: Integration tests for authentication flows, error boundaries for module failures
- **Security**: CSP headers, role-based menu items, server-side authorization validation
- **Development**: Storybook for component documentation, Chromatic for visual regression testing

## Tools and Libraries to Use
- **Build Tool**: Webpack 5 with Module Federation plugin or Vite with federation plugin
- **Routing**: React Router 6 with lazy loading capabilities
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with design token integration
- **State Management**: React Query for API state, avoid shared global state
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E
- **Documentation**: Storybook 7 for component library
- **Visual Testing**: Chromatic for visual regression testing
- **Error Handling**: React Error Boundaries for module loading failures

## Security Considerations
- **CSP Headers**: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' for secure script loading
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control with server-side validation
- **CSRF Protection**: Proper CSRF tokens and validation
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user inputs and use secure headers
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with request rate limiting
- **Session Management**: Secure session tokens with proper expiration

## Performance Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based splitting for optimal chunk sizes
- **Lazy Loading**: React.lazy() with Suspense for component loading
- **Preloading**: Critical component preloading to prevent UX delays
- **Bundle Analysis**: Use Webpack Bundle Analyzer for optimization
- **Caching**: Proper HTTP caching for static assets and API responses
- **Network Optimization**: Minimize network requests and optimize payload sizes
