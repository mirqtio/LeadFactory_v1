# Research Context for PRP-1054 - Scoring Playground Integration

## Key Findings

### 2024 Workflow Automation Trends
- Market growing at 20% per year, reaching $5B USD by 2024
- Processes with generative AI grew by 400% in 2023
- 61% of automated processes now considered complex (scoring 5+ out of 10)
- 95% of companies using generative AI, 79% implementing AI agents

### FastAPI + Pydantic Integration Patterns for Scoring
- FastAPI fully compatible with Pydantic for robust data validation
- Automatic request validation using Python type hints
- Interactive documentation generation via Swagger UI integration
- Performance optimization through reduced model complexity and strategic BaseModel usage

### Modern Async SQLAlchemy Patterns (2024)
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ provides improved async experience for FastAPI
- Async database sessions prevent blocking of concurrent operations
- Production-ready session management with dependency injection
- Significant performance improvements through asyncio integration

## Current Best Practices

### API Design & Validation
- Use Python type hints for automatic request validation
- Leverage Pydantic BaseModel for complex data structures
- Implement model reusability across validation layers
- Generate interactive documentation automatically

### Database Integration
- Use AsyncSession with proper dependency injection
- Implement session management patterns for production
- Leverage SQLAlchemy 2.0+ async capabilities
- Apply query optimization for pagination and filtering

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize deeply nested Pydantic structures
- Use simple data structures (dict/dataclass) for read-heavy endpoints
- Implement async patterns to prevent request blocking
- Choose appropriate server setup (Uvicorn + Gunicorn for production)

### Monitoring & Observability
- Integrate Pydantic Logfire for production monitoring
- Track message flows and performance metrics
- Implement streaming responses for large data sets
- Use proper error handling and logging patterns

## Common Pitfalls

### Performance Issues
- Overuse of Pydantic BaseModel validation adds overhead
- Deeply nested model structures impact performance
- Blocking database operations in async endpoints
- Inefficient query patterns for pagination

### Integration Challenges
- Session management complexity in async environments
- Dependency injection configuration issues
- Type hint conflicts between Pydantic and SQLAlchemy
- Complex data validation logic increasing response times

### Security Vulnerabilities
- Insufficient input validation leading to injection attacks
- Improper session handling exposing sensitive data
- Missing authentication/authorization in scoring endpoints
- Inadequate error handling revealing system internals

## Recent Updates

### SQLAlchemy 2.0+ Features
- Enhanced async support with improved performance
- Better integration patterns with FastAPI
- Modern session management approaches
- Improved type hint support

### Pydantic V2 Improvements
- Performance optimizations for data validation
- Enhanced integration with FastAPI automatic documentation
- Better error messages and debugging support
- Improved serialization performance

### FastAPI 0.100+ Features
- Enhanced async capabilities and performance
- Better dependency injection patterns
- Improved OpenAPI integration and documentation
- Advanced streaming response support

## Implementation Recommendations

### Architecture Approach
- Use async patterns throughout the scoring system
- Implement proper dependency injection for database sessions
- Design modular scoring components with clear interfaces
- Apply proper separation of concerns between validation and business logic

### Integration Strategy
- Leverage existing FastAPI + SQLAlchemy infrastructure
- Build reusable Pydantic models for scoring data structures
- Implement async session management for database operations
- Use proper error handling and validation patterns

### Tools and Libraries
- FastAPI 0.100+ for modern async API development
- Pydantic V2 for robust data validation and serialization
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with async support for database operations
- Uvicorn + Gunicorn for production deployment
- Alembic for database migrations
- Pytest for comprehensive testing

### Performance Considerations
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed scoring data
- Use async pagination for large result sets
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Monitor performance metrics in production environment
