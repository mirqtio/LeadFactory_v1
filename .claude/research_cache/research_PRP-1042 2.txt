# Research Context for PRP-1042 - Lead Explorer UI

## Key Findings

### React Data Grid Components for CRUD Operations (2024)
- **AG Grid**: Industry leader with comprehensive CRUD features, virtual rendering for performance
- **Material React Table**: MIT licensed, built on Material UI V6, full CRUD support with advanced features
- **Syncfusion React DataGrid**: Enterprise-grade with batch operations and Excel-like navigation
- **React Data Grid**: Lightweight, feature-rich, and highly customizable

### FastAPI React Integration Patterns
- Modern stack uses Vite for React development with FastAPI async backend
- Async CRUD operations leverage SQLAlchemy async patterns for high performance
- CORS configuration essential for localhost development (frontend:5173, backend:8000)
- Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Motor driver for async MongoDB operations when needed

### Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ARIA labels fully supported in JSX with hyphen-cased attributes
- Data grids must follow W3C WCAG standards with relevant ARIA tags
- Screen reader compatibility requires proper table structure and navigation
- Keyboard navigation and focus management are critical requirements
- Modern React grids are compliant with WCAG 2.2 AA and Section 508

### Design Token Implementation
- Single source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, shadows, borders
- CSS-in-JS integration with Styled Components or theme providers
- Component tokens inherit from semantic tokens for consistency
- 50% development time reduction reported by teams using design tokens
- Major libraries (MUI, Ant Design, Mantine) provide comprehensive token support

## Current Best Practices

### Framework-Specific Patterns
- **FastAPI**: Async SQLAlchemy with Pydantic validation, proper CORS configuration
- **React**: Component composition with hooks, virtual rendering for large datasets
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels with semantic meaning, keyboard navigation support
- **Design Tokens**: CSS custom properties with theme provider integration

### Testing Strategies
- Unit tests for CRUD operations and component behavior
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- Visual regression testing for UI consistency
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Error Handling Approaches
- Async/await patterns with proper error boundaries
- API error responses with meaningful status codes
- User-friendly error messages with accessibility considerations
- Graceful degradation for network failures

## Common Pitfalls

### Known Issues to Avoid
- Missing primary key configuration for CRUD operations
- Improper CORS setup causing API call failures
- ARIA label misuse that fails WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name
- Hard-coded design values instead of design tokens
- Non-async database operations causing performance bottlenecks

### Performance Considerations
- Virtual rendering essential for datasets >1000 rows
- Lazy loading for improved initial page load
- Debounced search and filter operations
- Efficient pagination strategies

### Security Vulnerabilities
- SQL injection through improper query parameterization
- XSS attacks via unsanitized user input rendering
- Missing authentication on CRUD endpoints
- Overly permissive CORS configuration

## Recent Updates

### Breaking Changes in Dependencies
- Material UI V6 migration patterns and compatibility
- React 18 concurrent features affecting data grids
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 async patterns and session management
- FastAPI dependency updates and security patches

### New Features to Leverage
- React Server Components for improved performance
- FastAPI dependency injection improvements
- Enhanced ARIA support in modern browsers
- Design token automation tools and workflows

### Deprecated Patterns to Avoid
- Class-based React components for new development
- Synchronous database operations in FastAPI
- Inline styles instead of design token system
- Non-semantic HTML in data table structures

## Implementation Recommendations

### Specific Approach Based on Research
1. **Component Selection**: Use Material React Table for Material UI integration or AG Grid for enterprise features
2. **Data Architecture**: Implement async FastAPI endpoints with Pydantic validation
3. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper ARIA labeling
4. **Design System**: Implement design tokens for consistent theming

### Integration Patterns to Follow
- Component composition over inheritance
- Async state management with React hooks
- Centralized error handling and user feedback
- Progressive enhancement for accessibility

### Tools and Libraries to Use
- **Frontend**: React 18+, Material React Table/AG Grid, React Hook Form
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy async, Pydantic
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E
- **Accessibility**: axe-core, react-axe for automated testing
- **Design**: Design tokens with CSS custom properties, theme provider
