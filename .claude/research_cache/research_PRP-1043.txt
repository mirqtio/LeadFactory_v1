# Research Context for PRP-1043

## Key Findings
- React Flow is the leading library for data lineage visualization with 17.6K GitHub stars
- Data lineage UIs require interactive node-based diagrams with drag-and-drop capabilities
- Audit trail patterns focus on chronological records with user, timestamp, and operation details
- React debugging interfaces benefit from component tree visualization and real-time monitoring
- Modern lineage tools emphasize visual transparency and expandable node details

- Audit Trail Technical Implementation: https://www.harness.io/blog/audit-trails-technical

## Current Best Practices
- Use React Flow for interactive node-based data lineage visualization
- Implement expandable nodes for detailed transformation information
- Provide visual highlighting and color coding for data flow paths
- Include chronological audit trail with user attribution and timestamps
- Support zooming, panning, and multi-node selection for complex diagrams
- Enable real-time updates and change history tracking
- Implement granular column-level lineage insights

## Common Pitfalls
- Performance issues with large datasets requiring viewport-based rendering
- Complex state management for interactive diagram features
- Accessibility challenges with visual-only information display
- Overwhelming UI with too much detail shown simultaneously
- Poor error handling for lineage data inconsistencies
- Lack of clear visual hierarchy in complex data flows

## Recent Updates
- React Flow v11+ supports nested nodes and improved performance
- React DevTools integration provides enhanced debugging capabilities
- Modern audit trail patterns emphasize event sourcing and microservices architecture
- Focus on operational transparency through real-time monitoring
- Emphasis on visual debugging tools and component isolation

## Implementation Recommendations
- Use React Flow as the primary visualization library
- Implement hierarchical node expansion for detailed view
- Create timeline-based audit trail component with filtering
- Add real-time updates using WebSocket connections
- Include accessibility features like screen reader support
- Implement responsive design for mobile debugging scenarios
- Use React Developer Tools patterns for component inspection
- Apply consistent design tokens for visual hierarchy
- Include export capabilities for lineage diagrams and audit logs
