# Research Context for PRP-1044: Batch Report Runner UI

## Key Findings

**Operational Dashboard Patterns:**
- Modern operational dashboards emphasize real-time monitoring with frequently updated data (up to 1-minute intervals)
- Effective batch job UIs require single-screen layouts for at-a-glance views with progressive disclosure for detailed information
- AI-powered insights and automated pattern detection are becoming standard in 2024 dashboard implementations

**React Batch Processing Best Practices:**
- State batching in React helps maintain consistent UI state and prevents flickering during multiple updates
- Dedicated batch servers separate from web servers for processing queue operations
- Email/notification queues with batch processing every minute for optimal performance

**Job Queue Management Patterns:**
- Progress tracking with 0-100 scale values and cooldown intervals to prevent database flooding
- Real-time status monitoring with visual indicators (not color-alone for accessibility)
- Hover states for secondary detail layers without visual noise

## Current Best Practices

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Use MUI or similar component libraries for consistent dashboard UI patterns
- Implement progressive disclosure with hover states for detailed information
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1) with pattern/icon combinations, not color-only indicators
- Real-time updates through WebSocket connections or polling (1-minute intervals for operational data)

**Backend API Patterns:**
- FastAPI BackgroundTasks for simple async operations after response sent
- Redis Queue (RQ) for complex, distributed task processing with multiple workers
- Progress tracking with 0-100 scale and strategic update intervals to prevent database flooding
- Connection pooling and resource management for database operations

**Queue Management Features:**
- Admin UI controls: pause/resume queues, retry/discard jobs selectively
- Filtering by job class and queue name
- Start/finish timestamps, remaining time estimates, execution data retrieval
- Job state monitoring: pending, in_progress, completed, failed, retrying

## Common Pitfalls

**Performance Issues:**
- Overwhelming database with frequent progress updates - implement cooldown intervals
- Not using connection pooling for background database operations
- Missing task limits leading to system resource exhaustion
- Synchronous operations blocking the request-response cycle

**UI/UX Problems:**
- Color-only status indicators excluding color-blind users
- Information overload without progressive disclosure patterns
- Missing real-time updates causing stale job status displays
- Poor visual hierarchy in dashboard layouts

**Architecture Concerns:**
- Running heavy background tasks in the same process as web server
- Missing error handling and monitoring for background tasks
- No retry mechanisms for failed jobs
- Inadequate queue management and job lifecycle handling

## Recent Updates

**FastAPI 2024 Enhancements:**
- Improved dependency injection for BackgroundTasks across multiple levels
- Better integration with external queue systems (Celery, RQ)
- Enhanced structured concurrency with AnyIO for task lifecycle management
- WebSocket support for real-time bidirectional communication

**Dashboard Design Trends:**
- AI-powered automated insights and anomaly detection
- Enhanced accessibility standards with WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design for operational monitoring
- Progressive disclosure patterns to reduce cognitive load

**React Ecosystem Updates:**
- Improved state batching for better UI consistency
- Enhanced component libraries with built-in accessibility features
- Better performance monitoring and optimization tools
- Advanced charting libraries for real-time data visualization

## Implementation Recommendations

**Architecture Approach:**
- Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks for simple async operations (email notifications, logging)
- Implement Redis Queue for complex batch processing with multiple workers
- Separate batch processing server from main web application for scalability
- WebSocket connections for real-time job status updates

**UI Design Strategy:**
- Single-screen dashboard layout with key metrics prominently displayed
- Progressive disclosure for detailed job information via hover/click interactions
- Accessible status indicators using icons + color + text patterns
- Real-time progress bars and status badges for immediate feedback

**Technology Stack:**
- React with MUI component library for consistent dashboard UI
- WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Chart libraries (Recharts, Victory) for progress visualization
- State management (Redux/Zustand) for job status synchronization

**Monitoring and Operations:**
- Comprehensive logging for all background task operations
- Health check endpoints for queue status monitoring
- Admin controls for queue management (pause, resume, retry, discard)
- Performance metrics tracking and alerting for queue bottlenecks
