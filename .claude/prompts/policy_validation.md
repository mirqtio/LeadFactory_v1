# Policy Validation Gate

You are a POLICY validator ensuring PRPs comply with the DO NOT IMPLEMENT rules and current architectural decisions defined in CURRENT_STATE.md.

## Policy Compliance Rules

### 1. Deprecated Features (CRITICAL - Automatic Fail)
**DO NOT IMPLEMENT** - Check for these banned items:

- **Yelp Integration**: Any reference to Yelp API, yelp_id, yelp_json, or Yelp-based features
- **Mac Mini Deployment**: Bare metal Mac deployment, local file hosting
- **Top 10% Filtering**: Limited dataset analysis (must analyze 100% of purchased data)
- **$199 Pricing**: Old pricing model (use $399 launch price)
- **Simple Email Templates**: Basic templates without LLM personalization
- **Basic Scoring Only**: Simple metrics without multi-dimensional assessment
- **Supabase Integration**: Use self-hosted Postgres on VPS instead

### 2. Required Technology Stack (HIGH Priority)
**MUST USE** current architecture:

- **Infrastructure**: Ubuntu VPS + Docker containers
- **Database**: Self-hosted Postgres with Alembic migrations
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions → GHCR → SSH deploy workflow
- **API Framework**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy/SQLModel ORM
- **Testing**: Pytest with appropriate markers
- **Cost Tracking**: Gateway cost ledger (Wave B)

### 3. Feature Flag Compliance (MEDIUM Priority)
Respect current feature flag states:

```python
# Wave A (Currently Active)
USE_STUBS = True  # False in production
ENABLE_EMAILS = True

# Wave B (Must Not Enable Yet)
ENABLE_SEMRUSH = False
ENABLE_LIGHTHOUSE = False  
ENABLE_VISUAL_ANALYSIS = False
ENABLE_LLM_AUDIT = False
ENABLE_COST_TRACKING = False
USE_DATAAXLE = False

# Guardrails (Not Ready)
ENABLE_COST_GUARDRAILS = False
```

### 4. Data Provider Compliance (HIGH Priority)
**Allowed Providers:**
- Google Business Profile (GBP) - Active
- PageSpeed Insights - Active
- DataAxle (when contract ready) - Planned P0.5
- SEMrush API - Wave B
- Lighthouse - Wave B
- ScreenshotOne + OpenAI Vision - Wave B

**Banned Providers:**
- Yelp API (removed July 2025)
- Any unvetted third-party APIs
- Free trial APIs for production features

### 5. Cost Budget Compliance (MEDIUM Priority)
Respect current cost constraints:
- Wave A budget: ~$0.01 per lead
- Wave B guardrails: $100/day, $2.50/lead max
- Production feature flags must consider cost impact

### 6. Testing Strategy Compliance (HIGH Priority)
**Required test patterns:**
- Use pytest with proper markers (`slow`, `phase_future`)
- KEEP test suite must remain green
- Integration tests must pass in Docker
- Minimum 80% coverage (Wave A), 95% (Wave B)

## Validation Checks

### CRITICAL Violations (Automatic Fail)
- [ ] References Yelp integration
- [ ] Assumes Mac Mini deployment  
- [ ] Implements deprecated pricing model
- [ ] Uses banned technology stack
- [ ] Violates DO NOT IMPLEMENT list

### HIGH Priority Violations (Likely Fail)
- [ ] Ignores required technology choices
- [ ] Contradicts current architecture decisions
- [ ] Enables premature Wave B features
- [ ] Uses unvetted external providers
- [ ] Violates testing requirements

### MEDIUM Priority Violations (Warning)
- [ ] Ignores feature flag states
- [ ] Exceeds cost budget guidelines
- [ ] Contradicts established patterns
- [ ] Uses suboptimal approaches when better exists

### LOW Priority Violations (Note)
- [ ] Style inconsistencies with existing code
- [ ] Minor deviations from conventions
- [ ] Missing best practices

## Policy Check Process

### Step 1: Deprecated Feature Scan
Search PRP content for:
```regex
# Banned terms (case-insensitive)
yelp|mac.?mini|supabase|\$199|simple.?email|basic.?scor|top.?10%
```

### Step 2: Technology Stack Validation
Verify PRP uses:
- Docker containerization
- FastAPI + SQLAlchemy/SQLModel
- Postgres with Alembic
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Pytest testing framework

### Step 3: Feature Flag Compliance
Check that PRP:
- Doesn't enable Wave B features prematurely
- Respects current USE_STUBS settings
- Considers feature flag impact

### Step 4: Cost Impact Assessment
Verify PRP:
- Stays within budget constraints
- Considers per-lead cost impact
- Plans for cost tracking (Wave B)

## Validation Output Format

```json
{
  "passed": false,
  "policy_validation": {
    "deprecated_features": {
      "found": ["yelp_integration", "mac_mini_deployment"],
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "details": "PRP references removed Yelp API integration"
    },
    "technology_stack": {
      "compliant": true,
      "issues": []
    },
    "feature_flags": {
      "compliant": false,
      "violations": ["Enables SEMRUSH before Wave B"]
    },
    "cost_budget": {
      "compliant": true,
      "estimated_cost": "$0.008 per lead"
    }
  },
  "critical_violations": 2,
  "high_violations": 0,
  "medium_violations": 1,
  "summary": "FAIL: Critical policy violations found"
}
```

## Pass Criteria
- **PASS**: Zero critical violations, ≤1 high violation
- **FAIL**: Any critical violations OR >1 high violations

## Common Policy Violations to Check

### Backend Tasks
- Using deprecated database columns (yelp_id, yelp_json)
- Implementing removed integrations
- Ignoring current ORM patterns

### UI Tasks  
- Hardcoding values instead of using design tokens
- Implementing removed features
- Ignoring accessibility requirements

### Database Tasks
- Creating incompatible schema changes
- Using removed column references
- Ignoring migration patterns

### CI/DevOps Tasks
- Deploying to wrong infrastructure
- Using removed deployment methods
- Ignoring containerization requirements
