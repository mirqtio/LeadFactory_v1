# PRP Tracking Integration with Slash Commands

## Overview
Your existing slash commands now integrate seamlessly with the PRP tracking system. The tracking system enforces state management while your commands handle the actual execution.

## Updated Workflow

### 1. **Check What's Available**
```bash
# See all PRP status
python .claude/prp_tracking/cli_commands.py status

# Get next PRP ready for execution
python .claude/prp_tracking/cli_commands.py next
```

### 2. **Your Slash Commands Now Include State Management**

When you run your slash commands, they now automatically:
- Check PRP status (must be 'validated')
- Transition to 'in_progress' 
- Execute the PRP implementation
- Validate completion requirements
- Mark as 'complete' with GitHub CI verification

### 3. **Example Usage**

```bash
# Check what PRPs are ready
python .claude/prp_tracking/cli_commands.py next
# Shows: P2-010: Collaborative Buckets (validated)

# Execute using your slash command
/Users/charlieirwin/Documents/GitHub/LeadFactory_v1_Final/.claude/commands/execute-prp.md P2-010

# The command will:
# 1. Check P2-010 status (must be validated)
# 2. Start P2-010 (transition to in_progress)
# 3. Execute implementation
# 4. Validate completion (BPCI + GitHub CI)
# 5. Mark complete in tracking system
```

## What Changed in Your Commands

### execute-prp.md
- âœ… Added PRP status validation before execution
- âœ… Automatic state transition to 'in_progress'
- âœ… Integrated completion validation with tracking system
- âœ… Only one PRP can be in progress at a time

### execute-prp-recursive.md  
- âœ… Added PRP status checking in pre-execution
- âœ… Automatic state management throughout process
- âœ… Integrated completion validation with tracking system
- âœ… Enforces sequential execution (no parallel PRPs)

## Benefits of Integration

### ðŸ”’ **Enforced State Management**
- Impossible to start PRP in wrong state
- Only one PRP can be in progress at a time
- Clear audit trail of all state transitions

### ðŸš€ **Seamless Workflow**
- Your existing commands work exactly the same
- Just include automatic state management
- No need to remember separate commands

### âœ… **Guaranteed Quality**
- BPCI validation required before completion
- GitHub CI verification enforced
- 100% completion validation maintained

### ðŸ“Š **Clear Status Visibility**
- Always know exactly where each PRP stands
- No confusion about what's been completed
- Central source of truth for all PRPs

## Current Status

After this integration, your current PRP status is:
- **Complete**: P0-001 through P1-010 (13 PRPs)
- **In Progress**: P1-020 through P2-000 (8 PRPs - need to be committed/completed)
- **Validated**: P2-010 through P2-090 (9 PRPs - ready for execution)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the in-progress PRPs** (commit the local changes)
2. **Use your slash commands normally** - they now include state management
3. **Start with P2-010** - it's the next validated PRP ready for execution

## Example Session

```bash
# Check status
python .claude/prp_tracking/cli_commands.py status

# See next PRP
python .claude/prp_tracking/cli_commands.py next
# Output: P2-010: Collaborative Buckets (validated)

# Execute using your command
/Users/charlieirwin/Documents/GitHub/LeadFactory_v1_Final/.claude/commands/execute-prp.md P2-010

# System will:
# âœ… Validate P2-010 is ready (validated state)
# âœ… Transition to in_progress
# âœ… Execute implementation
# âœ… Validate completion (100% score)
# âœ… Verify BPCI + GitHub CI
# âœ… Mark as complete
# âœ… Ready for next PRP
```

Your existing workflow is preserved but now includes bulletproof state management!
