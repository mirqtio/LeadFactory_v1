# LeadFactory MVP - Complexity Assessment

## Executive Summary

The LeadFactory MVP is a highly complex project with **100+ interdependent tasks** across 12 domains (D0-D11). The critical path through the system requires careful orchestration to meet the 48-72 hour revenue target.

### Overall Complexity Score: 8.5/10

**Key Factors:**
- Multiple external API integrations (Yelp, PageSpeed, OpenAI, Stripe, SendGrid)
- Real-time payment processing and report generation
- Complex scoring algorithm with vertical-specific rules
- Stringent performance requirements (5k businesses in 4 hours)
- CI-first development with zero local/CI discrepancies

    K --> L
```

**Minimum Time to Revenue: 36-48 hours** (assuming perfect execution)

### 1.2 Secondary Critical Paths

1. **Testing Infrastructure Path** (8-10 hours)
   - Docker test environment → CI pipeline → Test utilities → Fixtures

2. **Data Pipeline Path** (12-16 hours)
   - Models → Migrations → CRUD operations → Batch processing

3. **Monitoring Path** (6-8 hours)
   - Prometheus metrics → Logging → Error tracking → Dashboards

## 2. Resource Requirements

### 2.1 Development Resources

**Single Developer Bandwidth:**
- **Focus Time:** 10-12 hour blocks required for complex integrations
- **Context Switching:** Minimize to <3 domain switches per day
- **AI Assistant Usage:** 80% of coding through Claude Code

**Estimated Time by Domain:**
```
D0 Gateway:        8-10 hours (complex rate limiting, circuit breakers)
D1 Targeting:      4-6 hours  (simpler CRUD operations)
D2 Sourcing:       6-8 hours  (Yelp API complexity, pagination)
D3 Assessment:     10-12 hours (multiple sub-assessments, parallel execution)
D4 Enrichment:     4-6 hours  (fuzzy matching complexity)
D5 Scoring:        8-10 hours (rule engine, YAML configuration)
D6 Reports:        8-10 hours (PDF generation, template complexity)
D7 Storefront:     10-12 hours (Stripe webhooks, idempotency)
D8 Personalization: 6-8 hours  (LLM integration, spam scoring)
D9 Delivery:       8-10 hours (SendGrid webhooks, compliance)
D10 Analytics:     4-6 hours  (basic metrics only for MVP)
D11 Orchestration: 6-8 hours  (Prefect setup, error handling)

Total: 82-106 hours of development time
```

### 2.2 Infrastructure Resources

**Development Machine:**
- Mac Mini M4: Sufficient for all tasks
- Docker: 4-6GB RAM allocation needed
- Concurrent containers: Max 3 (test, stub server, database)

**External Service Quotas:**
```
Yelp API:      5,000 calls/day (hard limit)
PageSpeed API: 25,000 calls/day
OpenAI:        $50/day budget (~5,000 assessments)
SendGrid:      100 emails/day (deliverability limit)
```

## 3. Risk Factors

### 3.1 High-Risk Areas (Probability × Impact)

1. **Stripe Webhook Reliability** (High/Critical)
   - Risk: Payment succeeded but report generation fails
   - Mitigation: Idempotent webhook processing, retry queues

2. **Email Deliverability** (High/Critical)
   - Risk: Emails land in spam, no opens/clicks
   - Mitigation: Warm-up period, spam scoring, A/B testing

3. **API Rate Limits** (Medium/High)
   - Risk: Hit Yelp limit mid-batch
   - Mitigation: Precise quota tracking, graceful degradation

4. **PDF Generation at Scale** (Medium/High)
   - Risk: Memory/CPU exhaustion with concurrent PDFs
   - Mitigation: Queue system, resource pooling

5. **LLM Costs** (Medium/Medium)
   - Risk: Exceed $0.02/lead budget
   - Mitigation: Prompt optimization, caching similar assessments

### 3.2 Technical Debt Risks

1. **SQLite in Production** (Acceptable for MVP)
   - Plan PostgreSQL migration for Week 2

2. **No Queue System** (High risk at scale)
   - Add Celery/RabbitMQ after revenue validation

3. **Basic Error Handling** (Medium risk)
   - Enhance after first production issues

## 4. Parallelization Opportunities

### 4.1 Parallel Development Tracks

**Track 1: Core Pipeline** (Developer Focus)
- D0 → D2 → D3 → D5 → D8 → D9

**Track 2: Revenue Systems** (Can be developed in parallel)
- D7 (Stripe) → D6 (Reports)

**Track 3: Infrastructure** (AI Assistant can handle)
- Database models
- Docker setup
- CI configuration
- Stub server

### 4.2 Parallel Execution Opportunities

1. **Assessment Phase** (3x speedup possible)
   ```python
   # Can run simultaneously
   - PageSpeed analysis
   - Tech stack detection  
   - LLM insights
   ```

2. **Batch Processing** (10x speedup possible)
   ```python
   # Process multiple geo×vertical batches concurrently
   # Limit: API quotas and memory
   ```

3. **Email Delivery** (Bounded by SendGrid)
   ```python
   # Batch API calls but respect rate limits
   # Max: 10 emails per API call
   ```

## 5. Bottlenecks in 48-72 Hour Timeline

### 5.1 Critical Bottlenecks

1. **Stripe Webhook Testing** (4-6 hours)
   - Cannot parallelize
   - Requires careful testing of all edge cases
   - Blocks revenue generation

2. **End-to-End Integration Testing** (6-8 hours)
   - Must test full flow: Yelp → Email → Payment → Report
   - Catches integration issues
   - Cannot skip without high risk

3. **Docker CI Environment** (2-4 hours per issue)
   - Any environment mismatch costs hours
   - Must match production exactly

### 5.2 Non-Critical But Time-Consuming

1. **Comprehensive Monitoring** (defer to Week 2)
2. **A/B Testing Framework** (defer to Week 2)
3. **Advanced Analytics** (basic metrics only for MVP)

   - All test writing in blocks

2. **Provide Complete Context**
   - Always reference PRD sections
   - Include test examples
   - Show expected output

3. **Minimize Clarification Rounds**
   - Over-specify rather than under-specify
   - Include error cases upfront

### 7.2 Time Optimization

1. **Skip Non-Critical Features**
   - No admin UI
   - Basic email templates only
   - Minimal analytics

2. **Use Existing Libraries**
   - SQLAlchemy for ORM (no custom)
   - Prefect for orchestration (no custom)
   - Playwright for PDF (no wkhtmltopdf)

3. **Defer Optimizations**
   - No caching initially (add if needed)
   - Basic error handling only
   - No performance tuning until after revenue
