# AI CTO Dashboard - CI Status Tracker

## Overview

The AI CTO Dashboard provides real-time visibility into the actual completion status of tasks based on Git commits and CI status. It enforces the strict definition from CLAUDE.md that a task is ONLY complete when:

1. Code is implemented and validated
2. Pushed to GitHub main branch  
3. ALL CI checks pass GREEN

## Components

### 1. Dashboard HTML (`ai_cto_dashboard.html`)
- Auto-refreshing dashboard that shows:
  - Tasks that are actually committed and pushed to GitHub
  - Local uncommitted work
  - Tasks not yet started
  - Current git repository status
  - Metrics and visual status indicators

### 2. Update Script (`update_dashboard_ci_status.py`)
- Python script that checks git status and updates the dashboard
- Detects which P0 tasks have been committed vs just local changes
- Generates updated HTML with real-time status

### 3. Continuous Updater (`dashboard_continuous_updater.py`)
- Runs the update script every 30 seconds
- Provides live updates without manual intervention

### 4. Docker Container Script (`start_dashboard_container.sh`)
- Starts an nginx container to serve the dashboard
- Accessible at http://localhost:8080

## Usage

### Manual Update
```bash
python update_dashboard_ci_status.py
```

### Continuous Updates (Every 30s)
```bash
python dashboard_continuous_updater.py
```

### Start Dashboard Web Server
```bash
./start_dashboard_container.sh
```
