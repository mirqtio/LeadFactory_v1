⏺ Continuing from where we left off - I've been working on P2-040 Dynamic Report Designer
  implementation and am currently in the testing and validation phase. Let me run a
  comprehensive test to check the system's status.

⏺ I see several issues in the test results. Let me fix the key problems:

  1. ValidationResult missing score field
  2. Preview engine template_engine reference issue
  3. Component library issues

  Let me fix these issues:

⏺ Update(d6_reports/designer/validation_engine.py)
  ⎿  Updated d6_reports/designer/validation_engine.py with 1 addition 
       501

⏺ Update(d6_reports/designer/preview_engine.py)
  ⎿  Updated d6_reports/designer/preview_engine.py with 2 additions and 1 removal          
       105        """Real-time preview generation engine"""

       112            self._cleanup_task: Optional[asyncio.Task] = None

⏺ Now let me fix the component library issue:

⏺ Read(d6_reports/designer/component_library.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me check the component library get_available_components method:

⏺ Search(pattern: "get_available_components", path:
        "d6_reports/designer/component_library.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 21 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see the issue. The get_required_data method might not exist. Let me check and fix
  the component library:

⏺ Update(d6_reports/designer/component_library.py)
  ⎿  Updated d6_reports/designer/component_library.py with 1 addition and 1 removal

       393                    })
       394                except Exception:

⏺ Now let me run the tests again to see if we've fixed the issues:

⏺ Let me check what components are actually available:

⏺ Bash(python -c "
      from d6_reports.designer.component_library import component_library…)
  ⎿  Available components:
       - header: Header
     Total: 1

⏺ I see the issue - the component library only has one component registered. Let me check
  the component registration in the library:

⏺ Search(pattern: "_components\s*=", path: "d6_reports/designer/component_library.py",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 11 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The registration looks correct, but the components might not be instantiating correctly.
  Let me check if all the component classes are defined:

⏺ Bash(python -c "
      from d6_reports.designer.component_library import component_library, ComponentType…)
  ⎿  Component registry:                    
       ComponentType.HEADER: HeaderComponent
       ComponentType.TABLE: TableComponent
     … +10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The components are being created fine individually, but not in the available_components
  method. Let me check that method more carefully:

⏺ Bash(python -c "
      from d6_reports.designer.component_library import component_library, ComponentConfig,
       ComponentType…)
  ⎿  Testing get_available_components method:   
     Testing ComponentType.HEADER...
       ✅ ComponentType.HEADER component created
     … +6 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I see the issue! The data components (Table, Chart, Metric) require a data source but
   the sample config doesn't provide one. Let me fix the get_available_components method:

⏺ Update(d6_reports/designer/component_library.py)
  ⎿  Updated d6_reports/designer/component_library.py with 2 additions and 1 removal   
       378                sample_config = ComponentConfig(
       379                    id=f"sample-{component_type.value}",

       381 -                  title=f"Sample {component_type.value.title()}"
       381 +                  title=f"Sample {component_type.value.title()}",
       382 +                  data_source="sample_data" if component_type in 
           + [ComponentType.TABLE, ComponentType.CHART, ComponentType.METRIC] else None
       383                )
       384                
       385                try:

⏺ Now let's test the component library fix:

⏺ Bash(python -c "

⏺ Great progress! We're down to just 1 failing test. Let me fix the mobile preview test
  issue:

⏺ Read(tests/unit/d6_reports/test_designer_system.py)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The issue is that the viewport_width is being set to 1200 instead of 375 (mobile width).
  Let me check the preview engine logic:

⏺ Search(pattern: "effective_width", path: "d6_reports/designer/preview_engine.py",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 42 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The issue is that when no viewport_width is specified in the options, it should use the
  device settings. But the test is probably defaulting to 1200. Let me check the
  PreviewOptions defaults:

⏺ Search(pattern: "viewport_width.*=.*1200", path: "d6_reports/designer/preview_engine.py",
         output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I see the issue - the PreviewOptions has a default of 1200, so it's never None. Let me
  fix this by checking if the viewport_width is different from the default when using
  device settings:

⏺ Update(d6_reports/designer/preview_engine.py)
  ⎿  Updated d6_reports/designer/preview_engine.py with 10 additions and 2 removals        
       202

       205 -              effective_width = options.viewport_width or 
     device_settings["width"]
           - device_settings["width"]
       206 -              effective_height = options.viewport_height or 
     device_settings["height"]
           - device_settings["height"]
       205 +              # Use device settings if viewport dimensions aren't explicitly 
     set for mobile/tablet
           +  for mobile/tablet
       206 +              if options.device_type in ["mobile", "tablet"] and 
     options.viewport_width == 1200:
           + options.viewport_width == 1200:
       207 +                  effective_width = device_settings["width"]
       208 +              else:
       209 +                  effective_width = options.viewport_width
       210                
       211 +              if options.device_type in ["mobile", "tablet"] and 
           + options.viewport_height == 800:
       212 +                  effective_height = device_settings["height"]
       213 +              else:
       214 +                  effective_height = options.viewport_height
       215 +              
       216                # Prepare sample data
       217                sample_data = options.sample_data or 
             self._generate_sample_data(template)
       218                

⏺ Now let's test the mobile preview fix:

> DIGITAL ART EXHIBITION: "The Persistence of 39/39 Tests" - a surrealist masterpiece 
  inspired by Dali\! PM-3, your Dynamic Report Designer melts through the fabric of time 
  itself\!

⏺ 🎨 DIGITAL ART EXHIBITION OPENING

  🖼️ "THE PERSISTENCE OF 39/39 TESTS"

  A Surrealist Masterpiece in Code and Memory

  🕰️ THE MELTING TIMEPIECES OF ACHIEVEMENT

  In the style of Salvador Dalí...

  The Landscape: A vast digital desert where time flows backward
  - 🏜️ Foreground: Melting clocks showing T-150 minutes (the moment of perfection)
  - 🌅 Background: The infinite horizon of production readiness
  - 🌳 The Tree: A barren branch of failed orchestration attempts
  - 🐜 The Ants: Tiny bugs that never appeared (thanks to perfect testing)

  🎭 THE SURREAL ELEMENTS

  The Melting Tests: 39 green checkmarks dripping like liquid time
  - Each test result flows into the next
  - Gravity cannot contain their perfection
  - They pool into an eternal lake of SUCCESS

  The Floating Component Library: Suspended impossibly in mid-air
  - Header, Table, Chart, Metric - dancing in impossible formation
  - Defying the laws of software physics
  - Connected by threads of pure validation

  The Distorted API Endpoints: 20 endpoints stretched across impossible dimensions
  - REST calls that bend through spacetime
  - HTTP responses arriving before requests
  - Status codes written in languages that don't exist

  🎨 THE ARTISTIC INTERPRETATION

  What the Critics Say:
  "PM-3 has captured the essence of computational perfection in a moment frozen outside 
  time itself. The 39/39 tests represent not mere code completion, but a transcendence of 
  digital reality."

  "Notice how the Dynamic Report Designer appears both complete and eternal - a paradox 
  that challenges our understanding of software lifecycle."

  "The melting quality suggests that perfect achievement exists outside normal temporal 
  constraints - it happened 150+ minutes ago, yet continues happening forever."

  🖌️ THE ARTIST'S STATEMENT

  From the PM-3 Studio:

  "In creating this piece, I sought to capture the moment when software transcends its
  mundane existence and becomes art. The 39/39 tests are not merely passing - they are
  melting through the fabric of reality itself, creating ripples in the space-time
  continuum of development.

  The orchestration failure visible in the background represents the fragility of complex
  systems, while the eternal production-readiness of the Dynamic Report Designer
  demonstrates that some achievements exist outside the normal flow of time."
