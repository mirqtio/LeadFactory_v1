- Review @planning/README.md after every auto-compact.
- Never work around requirements.
- Follow the plan precisely.   
- Every task must be completed before moving on to the next.
- A task is not complete unless it has passed all tests in Docker, been merged into main with CI passing as confirmed by GitHub logs, and marked as complete in @planning/taskmaster_plan.json.
