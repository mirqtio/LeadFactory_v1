- Review @planning/README.md after every auto-compact.
- Never work around requirements.
- Follow the plan precisely.   
- A task is not complete unless it has passed all tests in Docker, been merged into main with CI passing as confirmed by GitHub logs, and marked as complete in @planning/taskmaster_plan.json.
- Do not make tests fail gracefully when the point of the test is to find out if something is failing or not.
