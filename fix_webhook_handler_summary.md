# Webhook Handler Test Fix Summary

## Issue
The test suite had 24 ERROR statuses in the webhook handler tests:
- 18 errors in `tests/unit/d9_delivery/test_webhook_handler.py::TestWebhookHandler`
- 4 errors in `tests/unit/d9_delivery/test_webhook_handler.py::TestUtilityFunctions`
- 2 errors in `tests/unit/d9_delivery/test_webhook_handler.py::TestIntegration`

## Root Cause
The tests were trying to connect to a PostgreSQL database using the production database configuration instead of using an in-memory SQLite test database. The error was:
```
psycopg2.OperationalError: could not translate host name "postgres" to address: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

## Solution
Fixed the test file by:

1. **Removed database session imports**: Removed imports of `SessionLocal` and `engine` from `database.session`

2. **Created proper test fixtures**: Added test-specific database fixtures that create an in-memory SQLite database:
   - `db_engine`: Creates a SQLite engine for testing
   - `db_session`: Creates a session from the test engine
   - `webhook_handler`: Patches the WebhookHandler to use the test session

3. **Updated all database access**: Changed all instances where tests were using `SessionLocal()` context managers to use the test session from fixtures instead

4. **Maintained test isolation**: Each test class has its own database fixtures to ensure proper test isolation

## Result
All 25 tests in the webhook handler test file now pass successfully:
- ✅ 18 tests in TestWebhookHandler
- ✅ 4 tests in TestUtilityFunctions  
- ✅ 2 tests in TestIntegration
- ✅ 1 standalone test

This fix reduces the total test ERROR count from 44 to approximately 20, a significant improvement in test stability.
